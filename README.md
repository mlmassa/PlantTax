# PlantTax
Frostburg State University
Plant Taxonomy, Spring 2023

This project contains the code I used for work associated with the class. 
In the scripts folder, you will find R code that pulls a Google Sheets spreadsheet of plant specimens collected and then generates herbarium labels.
Additionally I have included a script that can extract waypoints from Garmin GPS files.
plant_summary.rmd is a document that generates my final report and makes a map of specimens, including a hillshade.
