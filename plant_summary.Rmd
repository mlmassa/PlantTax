# Introduction

Herbaria are valuable [@heberling2019].

"Herbaria are critical resources for documenting biological and environmental change in the unfolding era of human domination of earth systems"

"herbarium use has diversified from a few dominant research topics a century ago (e.g., taxonomic notes, botanical history, local observations), with many topics only recently emerging (e.g., biodiversity informatics, global change biology, DNA analyses). Specimens are now appreciated as temporally and spatially extensive sources of genotypic, phenotypic, and biogeographic data. Specimens are increasingly used in ways that influence our ability to steward future biodiversity."

Understanding the biogeography, ecology, and cultural significance of plant specimens [...]

## Objectives



# Methods

## Collections
Pressed.
I collected specimens from public, non-protected areas and from private lands where permission was obtained from the landowner. For each specimen, I identified the species and recorded locality, habitat, coordinates, and three or more associated species. Vouchers were pressed and mounted following University of Florida [].

Using the collected dataa, I created a spreadsheed of plant specimens. Digitizing this information allowed me to use code to generate herbarium labels, map specimen locations, and automate certain summary text. All coding was conducted in program R version `r glue("{version$major}.{version$minor}")` [@rcoreteam2023].
Code associated with this project is available at GitHub repo.

I created illustrations of select specimens depicting key characteristics.

# Specimens

I collected 20 specimens for the Frostburg State University herbarium in spring 2023 representing 19 species in `r n_distinct(plants$family)` families.
Specimens came from three counties in two states (Allegany, Maryland; Garrett, Maryland; and Wake, North Carolina; Figure \@ref(fig:map)).
At least one species (*Asplenium platyneuron*) was new for the Frostburg collection.
This document provides supporting information on the species collected.

```{r map, fig.width = 7.5, fig.height = 4, dpi = 300, fig.cap = "Collection sites for herbarium specimens during spring 2023. Left: all sites. Right: Sites in western Maryland. County lines are drawn in dark gray. Major roads are depicted in white."}

## **1.** `r plants$id[x]`: *`r plants$species[x]`* `r plants$authority[x]`

Family `r plants$family[x]`, order `r plants$order[x]` 

`r str_to_sentence(plants$common_name[x])` 

Collected `r format(plants$date[x], "%B %e")` from `r plants$site[x]` in `r plants$county[x]` County, `r plants$state[x]` (`r round(plants$lat[x], 5)`, `r round(plants$long[x], 5)`).

### Morphological description
*Dendrolycopodium dendroideum* is an erect, branching evergreen clubmoss with a sessile strobilus, which can be separated from *D. obscurum* by spreading microphylls on the vertical stem [@fov].

### Range and habitat
In Virginia, this species is found in high-elevation mountain habitats and northern hardwood forests, particularly in association with red spruce [@fov].
Elsewhere, the species is common to aspen-birch forests, bog edges, and moist forest soils [@nauertz1999].

### Ecology
As a plant with a creeping habit, *D. dendroideum* likely provides soil stability.

### Economic and cultural significance
The species has limited economic uses.
Lycopodium powder was an important component of early flash photography, and although there are still uses today, as a less-common species *D. dendroideum* is not a likely commercial source.
Like many lycopodes, this species regenerates slowly, with aerial stems not reaching maturity until 4 to 6 years of age [@nauertz1999], making it vulnerable to overharvesting.
*D. dendroideum* is also known to produce several alkaloids, including lycopodine, obscurine, L13, L16, and L17 [@manske1944].

`r if_else(!is.na(plants$inaturalist[x]), glue("Photos are available at {plants$inaturalist[x]}."), "")` 

### Morphological description
*Polystichum acrostichoides* is an evergreen fern with pinnate, dimorphic leaves growing from from 25-80 cm in length [@fov].
It has a clumping habit.
The petioles have light brown scales.
Pinnae have well-developed acroscopic auricles and serrulate-spiny margins.
Fertile blades have contrasted distal pinnae, upon which are confluent sori covering the abaxial surface which are covered by entire, deciduous indusia.

### Range and habitat
Christmas fern ranges throughout the eastern US to southeastern Canada.
It is common throughout its range in mesic to dry forests, where it is found on the forest floor and shady, rocky slopes [@fna].

### Ecology
After frost, the fronds are no longer erect and can hold leaf litter in place on the forest floor, controlling erosion and allowing soil to build.

### Economic and cultural significance
This species is also a popular ornamental garden planting.

```{r include = F}
x <- x + 1
```

## **3.** `r plants$id[x]`: *`r plants$species[x]`* `r plants$authority[x]`

Family `r plants$family[x]`, order `r plants$order[x]` 

`r str_to_sentence(plants$common_name[x])`

`r if_else(!is.na(plants$inaturalist[x]), glue("Photos are available at {plants$inaturalist[x]}."), "")` 

### Morphological description
*Huperzia lucidula* is a clubmoss with indeterminate, erect shoots that senesce and turn brown in trailing portions [@fov].
Unlike other clubmoss genera it has forked but not branched stems that produce sporangia in the leaf axis rather than in strobili.
Not evident in this specimen but unique to the genus are gemmae, clonal propagules produced at the top of stems that allow for vegetative propagation.

### Range and habitat
This species is found in shaded coniferous and mixed hardwood forests [@fna] and is mainly on forest soils rather than rock outcrops [@fov].
It ranges throughout eastern North America.

### Ecology
As a plant with a creeping habit that often forms large colonies, *H. lucidula* likely provides soil stability.

### Economic and cultural significance
Stems have traditionally been used as padding in cradleboards in several Native American cultures [@nauertz1999].

`r if_else(!is.na(plants$inaturalist[x]), glue("Photos are available at {plants$inaturalist[x]}."), "")` 

### Morphological description
*Asplenium platyneuron* is a common fern. 
It has short, non-proliferous roots and can form clumps [@fna].
Fertile leaves are longer than sterile leaves and stand taller but otherwise do not differ.
The common name comes from its lustrous reddish-brown petiole with blank indument.
Blades are pinnate, with the bases of pinnae auricled and overlapping the rachis.
Pinnae are longer than wide, and margins are crenate to serrulate.
Sporangia are linear and elongate.
This specimen possesses sori, some with indusia which are translucent and whitish [@fov].

### Range and habitat
*A. platyneuron* is common throughout a variety of habitat types including mesic and dry forests, rocky woodlands, and outcrops, where it grows on soil, rock, and wood.
This specimen was growing on a mossy, pulverized shale roadside.
It is found throughout the eastern United States, with few populations west of Texas or north of the Canadian border [@fna].
Most notably, the species also occurs in southern Africa, a trait unique among North American ferns.

### Ecology
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (Glomeromycota) associate mutualistically with the roots of this species [@west2009], providing protections from pathogens and herbivores and mobilizing nutrients.

### Economic and cultural significance
Historically, members of *Asplenium* were used to "remove disorders of the spleen" [@fernie1891].

`r if_else(!is.na(plants$inaturalist[x]), glue("Photos are available at {plants$inaturalist[x]}."), "")` 

### Morphological description
*Vinca minor* is a creeping or scrambling vine up to 100 cm in length that forms mats.
The leaves are glossy and evergreen, lanceolate or elliptic, broadest near the middle, and rounded at the base, which distinguishes this species from the larger, ovate-leaved *V. major* [@fov]. The flowers are blue to blue-violet.

### Range and habitat
It is locally frequent in disturbed forests and clearings.

### Ecology
A non-native species, *V. minor* is assigned a low invasiveness rank, but under the right conditions it can cover large areas and threaten native forest ground flora.

### Economic and cultural significance
It is used in the horticulture industry and is a common sight at the site of old homesteads and cemeteries.

<br><br>I collected this `r plants$common_name[x]` on `r format(plants$date[x], "%B %e")` from `r plants$site[x]` in `r plants$county[x]` County, `r plants$state[x]`.
`r if_else(!is.na(plants$inaturalist[x]), glue("Photos are available at {plants$inaturalist[x]}."), "")` 

### Morphological description
*Tussilago farfara* is a perennial flower with creeping rhizomes [@fov]. The leaves are alternate, with basal leaves developing after the florets into cordate, palmately-veined leaves with a white tomentum beneath and glabrous uppersides. The cauline leaves are reduced and scalelike. The capitulum is monocephalous and radiate, with ray florets narrow and yellow numbering 100-300 and disk flowers staminate and numbering 20-40.

### Range and habitat
A non-native species originally from Europe, coltsfoot can be found along roadsides, gravel or shale road or stream banks, and clearings.
Introduced populations occur in northeastern North America from Newfoundland to Ontario and Minnesota down to Tennessee and North Carolina, as well as in Washington and British Columbia [@fna].

### Ecology

### Economic and cultural significance
This species can be used as an expectorant and cough remedy.

`r if_else(!is.na(plants$inaturalist[x]), glue("Photos are available at {plants$inaturalist[x]}."), "")` 

### Morphological description
This sedge is colonial with clumps forming along elongate rhizomes that are red ad fibrillose at the base [@fov]. Culms are smooth and longer than the leaves. The terminal spikes are reddish and staminate measuring 7-20 mm, with pistillate spikes sessile and lower from 3-12 mm in length. The pistillate scales are approximately the same length as the perigynia and are straw-colored to brown or purplish. The perigynia are subglobose above a contracted base, pubescent, and have beaks from 0.5-1.2 mm in length. This specimen was collected too early to observe many of these characteristics.

### Range and habitat
*Carex pensylvanica* can be found in varied habitats, from dry to mesic forests, woodlands, barrens, balds, and clearings. It is abundant in rocky or shale habitats and is not limited by soil chemistry.

`r if_else(!is.na(plants$inaturalist[x]), glue("Photos are available at {plants$inaturalist[x]}."), "")` 

### Morphological description
*Equisetum arvense* is a widespread horsetail. The vegetative stems are greed, branched in whorls with a hollow center, and grow from 2-60 (sometimes to 100) cm [@fna]. The stem has squarish sheaths with dark teeth. The fertile stems are brown, unbranched, larger-sheathed, fleshy, and ephemeral.

### Range and habitat
The species ranges throughout North America from Alaska and Nunavut down to New Mexico, northern Texas, Tennessee, and North Carolina. It can be found in a variety of habitats including roadsides, riverbanks, fields, marshes, pasture, and tundra.

### Ecology
Horsetail extract has antifungal properties that make it a natural alternative to copper-based agricultural fungicides [@trebbi2021].

### Morphological description 
*Viola hastata* is a perennial, caulescent violet with creeping, glabrous rhizomes [@fov].
Stems are glabrous and occur singly or in pairs along the rhizome.
The leaves are simple with shallow serrations, and occasionally show silver-gray variegation.
Its name comes from the hastate to cordate leaf base with an acute tip.
Flowers are lemon-yellow, often with brown lines, with lateral 2 petals bearded [@fna].
The fruit is a glabrous, ovoid capsule containing bronze seeds.

### Range and habitat 
This species is restricted to the eastern United States from New York to Alabama excluding Florida, growing in the mountains and piedmont [@fna].
In Virginia, it is associated with acidic cove forests, montane oak forests, and northern hardwood forests, typically with dry to mesic, acidic and infertile soils [@fov].

### Ecology
As with many members of *Viola*, the species possesses insect-pollinated chasmogamous flowers as well as underdeveloped self-pollinated cleistogamous flowers.
In addition to pollinators, this species interacts with herbivores.
In Great Smoky Mountains National Park, *Viola* species including *V. hastata* were more common in deer exclosures than at reference sites or control plots where it was typically absent, indicating the species is vulnerable to overbrowsing [@webster2005].

### Morphological description 
*Claytonia caroliniana* is a small herbaceous perennial growing in tufts from a globose corm (which I collected but misplaced; see iNaturalist photos).
Its basal leaves are spatulate to elliptic and the cauline leaves are opposite and ovate to petiolate, separating it from *C. virginica* which has linear leaves [@fov].
Flowers grow in raceme inflorescences in groups of 6-20 with the lowest pedicels tubtended by bracts.
The white to pink petals have deep pink stripes, maturing to subglobose capsules that dehisce longitudinally.
Pink anthers are evident in this specimen.

### Range and habitat 
This species is restricted to the Appalachian mountains, New England, and Great Lakes region, with additional records in Iowa, and Newfoundland [@fna].
It is common to rare depending on region, and can be found in rich cove forests, northern hardwoods, and well-drained floodplains, often in calcareous soils [@fov]. This species is ranked S3 in Maryland (rare or uncommon in the state, with 21-100 occurrences) and is tracked by the Maryland Natural Heritage Program as a species of conservation concern, but ranked G5 (demonstrably secure) globally. I should not have collected it, but it was locally fairly common and the Flora of Virginia did not list it as a species of conservation concern.

### Ecology
As spring ephemerals, *Claytonia* species provide important resources to pollinators.
Two major pollinators are *Andrena erigeniae*, a solitary bee that specializes on pollen and is closely associated with *Claytonia*, and a bee-fly *Bombylius major* [@parker2018].

### Economic and cultural significance 
Spring beauty corms have a long history of foraging in indigenous cultures, being eaten raw or prepared as one would a potato [@kuhnlein1991].
They can be stored over winter.
The related species *C. virginica* has ethnobotanical use as anticonvulsive and contraceptive by the Iroquois [@herrick1995].

*Hexastylis* is a perennial herb with stout rhizomes.
The leaves are triangular to ovate-sagittate and often show variegation [@fov].
Flowers lie on the ground and are hard and brown.
The calyx tubes are urn-shaped.
Complex, minute flower characteristics that are lost on pressing are important to the identification of *Hexastylis* species [@fov], but the leaf characteristics break *H. arifolia* out first in the key.

### Range and habitat 
The species is limited to the Southeast, where it ranges from Florida to southern Virginia and east to Louisiana and Tennessee [@fna].
It is infrequent in mesic upland forests with oak and beech and occasional in wet flatwoods [@fov].

### Ecology
Members of this group are myrmecocohrous (exhibit ant-mediated seed dispersal).
Both fruiting phenology and ant activity are driven by temperature, leading to mutualistic synchrony [@warren2011].
In ecosytems invaded by Asian needle ant with a corresponding decline in native ant species, a failure of this mutualism leads to highly clumped plants without dispersal [@warren2015].

### Morphological description
The American beech is a large tree growing up to 35 m in height with smooth, gray bark [@fov]. Its slender twigs grow in a zigzag pattern and produce pointed buds with white trichomes. The leaves are elliptic to ovate with a cuneate base. The leaf margins are denticulate to serrate. Marcescent brown leaves are retained through winter.

### Range and habitat
Found in a variety of soils from nutrient-poor to acidic, this species grows both as an overstory tree leading to beech-maple climax communities as well as in the understory of fire-excluded forests in our region.
Its distribution has changed drastically through glaciations. During the Wisconsin full-glacial it was restricted to the southeast, but expansion occurred rapidly into the eastern Great Lakes region where its abundance is highest in modern times [@bennett1985].

### Ecology

American beech is impacted by beech bark disease, which is caused by the introduced beech scale insect (*Cryptococcus fagisuga*). First introduced in the 1890s from Europe, the beech scale insect has since spread throughout New England, parts of the Great Lakes region, and down the Appalachian mountains, including into western Maryland [@kibbe2018]. Following tissue damage by the beech scale insect, several fungal species infect the tree, leading to cankers and fruiting fungal bodies. While this condition does not typically kill the tree, it does reduce and yellow the canopy and weaken the trunk, leading to a phenomenon called "beech snap" in which weakened trees are easily felled by wind, posing a safety hazard. 

The progression of beech scale disease in a forest follows three stages [@kibbe2018]. In the first, the advance front, beech scale reproduces on trunks in low but increasing density. The front spreads slowly. In the second stage, the killing front, high density of scale insects leads to fungal infections and the first tree mortality after 3 to 6 years. Mature trees are more vulnerable than young trees and can face 50% mortality. In the third and final stage, the aftermath, up to 90% of beech trees may have died. The scale insect and fungal infection persists throughout the forest on remaining trees. While beech is not eliminated, it is typically confined to the understory as they regrow from root suckers. Because beech is a shade-tolerant species, regrowth can create problems when dense understory cover of young beech prevents other tree species from regenerating. This disease has only reached around 30% of the range of *Fagus grandifolia* and will likely continue to expand.

Beech leaf disease, a pathogen affecting multiple other ornamental beech species along with American beech, first appeared in northeast Ohio in 2012 and has since expanded to the Lake Erie region and parts of New England, though the disease has not yet reached western Maryland [@martin2022]. While it does not commonly cause mortality, this infection causes dark banding between lateral leaf veins and a shrunken or crinkled appearance, leading to premature leaf drop and canopy thinning. It more heavily impacts smaller trees, in contrast to beech scale disease.

The loss of beech trees poses a risk to the ecology of beech forests. Beech nuts are important sources of food for a variety of mammals and were once a primary food of the passenger pigeon [@conrad2005]. It is also used as timber and as firewood or in smoking meats and cheeses. Beech trees produce nuts starting when they are around 20 years old and reach peak production at the age of 40-50 [@matt2022]. The loss of large trees to beech scale could drastically reduce the amount of mast available for consumption by wildlife by eliminating trees old enough to produce.

### Economic and cultural significance
Native American uses for beech include treatment of worms, consumption, heart issues, and as a poultice for burns and poison ivy [@fna].

### Morphological description
Perennial, caulescent herb lacking stolons or bulbs [@fna]. The aerial stems are 10-25 cm in height, initially erect but may become prostrate or stolon-like, and possess antrorsely appressed hairs. Both basal and cauline leaves are present, with oblong stipules. There are three leaflets with an obcordate shape, lobed to approximately 1/4 the length of the leaf. The inflorescences form umbelliform cymes with 1-3, rarely  8, 5-parted flowers. The corollas are yellow and unlined.

### Range and habitat
Common in pastures, lawns, road edges, and gravelly to sandy soils, this species is widespread and occurs in every state except California and Nevada.

### Ecology
*Oxalis* is commonly visited by small bees, which pollinate, and bee flies, which typically eat the pollen. Several songbirds and upland gamebirds consume the seeds.
The leaves have a slightly sour taste and are edible.
Oxalic acid, extracted from plants in this family, has industrial applications in cleaning and rust removal.
