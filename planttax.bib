Significant trends for earlier-flowering species range from -3.2 to -46 days, while those for later-flowering species range from +3.1 to +10.4 days. Advances of first-flowering in these 89 species are directly correlated with local increase in minimum temperature (Tmin).},

  abstract = {Populations of grassland songbirds continue to decline, and grasslands devoted to conservation are rare across the Great Plains. To gain the most value from grasslands for grassland birds, we must understand what types of management benefit these species. We evaluated the relative abundance of grassland birds on ownership types and the association of different land use activities with their abundance. We surveyed a wide range of grasslands (e.g., from idle to heavily managed, from remnant prairie to reconstructed) across western Minnesota and northwestern Iowa, USA, in 2013 and 2014. Sites surveyed covered a gradient of landscape context, management history (fire, grazing, reconstruction), and public and private ownership. We evaluated the influence of ownership and management history on the abundance of 12 species of grassland birds by comparing Akaike's Information Criterion values of linear models that included the variables of interest to models that included only local and landscape habitat factors. Ownership explained additional variation in bird abundance beyond local and landscape variables for 7 of the 12 species, and 5 species were more common on private lands. Fire or grazing history explained variation in bird abundance for 11 species, and 7 species had greater abundance on remnant prairie than on reconstructed grassland. For all but 1 species, ownership and management factors significantly improved models above a base model of local and landscape variables typically used to predict abundance. Our results suggest remnant prairie plays an important role for grassland birds, and that grazing could be a tool to increase abundance of some grassland bird species in the region. Furthermore, tracking management history of public lands in a consistent and accessible way could help improve landscape-based models for these species. © 2018 The Wildlife Society.},

When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure.

We use density distribution models derived from a robust regional bird abundance dataset, coupled with habitat conservation plans, to evaluate a network of protected areas and to inform conservation and biodiversity planning in the greater Klamath Siskiyou Bioregion, an area recognized globally as a region of outstanding biological diversity. Our novel modeling approach allowed for comparisons of abundance of conservation focal species on federal vs. non-federal lands, federal lands that are protected to maintain natural habitats vs. federal lands managed for multiple uses, and seven protected areas of interest. Our comparisons highlight conservation opportunities for suites of species associated with coniferous forests, oak woodlands, and grasslands. Specifically, we found that species associated with oak woodland and grassland habitats, both habitats of conservation concern, were not well represented in the Bioregion's existing protected areas. These species would benefit from expanding the regional protected area network to include their associated at-risk habitats. In contrast, our results suggest that coniferous forests birds are well represented in the Bioregion's protected areas. We identify management opportunities specifically associated with the restoration of fire-adapted ecosystems that would benefit coniferous forest focal species on both federally protected areas and other multiple-use lands. Our analysis provides an example of how a finer-scaled evaluation of a regional protected area network adds value to course-scale evaluations of protected areas and biological diversity. Data and results from this research were used to inform science-based expansion of the Bioregion's network of protected areas.},

Classification of such traits has led to a change in focus from research on the impact of fire as a disturbance factor on individual species, towards research into plant functional types associated with fire. This has led to a better understanding of the timing and geographic evolution of such traits as either fire-adapted or as a selective response to other disturbance factors. The identification of fire-survival and fire-persistence traits in fire-prone ecosystems is the first focus of this paper.

Here we illustrate how latent variable structural equation modelling of regional time series data can effectively describe interconnected drivers of population fluctuations in dynamic landscapes and can help to reveal previously unknown system drivers. Using a declining farmland-dependent bird species (Ammodramus savannarum) in the eastern United States (1994–2015) as a case study, our analysis reveals how farm management decisions drive population fluctuations (R2 = 20\%), while management is in turn highly influenced by climate (R2 = 23\%–51\%), but not by regional conservation spending. Synthesis and applications. Structural equation modelling revealed potential social–ecological pathways for halting regional population declines in a grassland bird, the Grasshopper Sparrow. Lower population growth rates followed years of higher hay yields ( 4 percentage points per metric ton increase in hay yield) and later harvests ( 2 percentage points per 10-day delay in harvest). Thus, one pathway for stabilising regional populations could involve compensating farmers for reducing hay harvests, potentially requiring a six-fold increase in current annual agri-environmental conservation spending.},

  abstract = {Global efforts to reduce tropical deforestation rely heavily on the establishment of protected areas. Measuring the effectiveness of these areas is difficult because the amount of deforestation that would have occurred in the absence of legal protection cannot be directly observed. Conventional methods of evaluating the effectiveness of protected areas can be biased because protection is not randomly assigned and because protection can induce deforestation spillovers (displacement) to neighboring forests. We demonstrate that estimates of effectiveness can be substantially improved by controlling for biases along dimensions that are observable, measuring spatial spillovers, and testing the sensitivity of estimates to potential hidden biases. We apply matching methods to evaluate the impact on deforestation of Costa Rica's renowned protected-area system between 1960 and 1997. We find that protection reduced deforestation: approximately 10\% of the protected forests would have been deforested had they not been protected. Conventional approaches to evaluating conservation impact, which fail to control for observable covariates correlated with both protection and deforestation, substantially overestimate avoided deforestation (by over 65\%, based on our estimates). We also find that deforestation spillovers from protected to unprotected forests are negligible. Our conclusions are robust to potential hidden bias, as well as to changes in modeling assumptions. Our results show that, with appropriate empirical methods, conservation scientists and policy makers can better understand the relationships between human and natural systems and can use this to guide their attempts to protect critical ecosystem services.},

Such models are {$<$}2 ΔAIC units because the penalty for one additional parameter is +2 AIC units, but model deviance is not reduced by an amount sufficient to overcome the 2-unit penalty and, hence, the additional parameter provides no net reduction in AIC. Simply put, the uninformative parameter does not explain enough variation to justify its inclusion in the model and it should not be interpreted as having any ecological effect. Models with uninformative parameters are frequently presented as being competitive in the Journal of Wildlife Management, including 72\% of all AIC-based papers in 2008, and authors and readers need to be more aware of this problem and take appropriate steps to eliminate misinterpretation. I reviewed 5 potential solutions to this problem: 1) report all models but ignore or dismiss those with uninformative parameters, 2) use model averaging to ameliorate the effect of uninformative parameters, 3) use 95\% confidence intervals to identify uninformative parameters, 4) perform all-possible subsets regression and use weight-of-evidence approaches to discriminate useful from uninformative parameters, or 5) adopt a methodological approach that allows models containing uninformative parameters to be culled from reported model sets. The first approach is preferable for small sets of a priori models, whereas the last 2 approaches should be used for large model sets or exploratory modeling.},

This response appears to be rooted in the perception that grassland birds invaded the East Coast from western grasslands after European settlers cleared the forest. Detailed historical accounts and analysis of pollen deposits, however, show that open grasslands existed on the East Coast of North America at the time of European settlement. Extensive grasslands resulted from burning and agricultural clearing by Native Americans. Natural disturbances, such as wildfire and beaver (Castor canadensis) activity, produced grasslands even before Native Americans cleared the forest. The presence of specialized grassland birds in Pleistocene deposits and in the earliest ornithological collections from eastern North America, and the existence of distinctive eastern populations of the Greater Prairie-Chicken (5mpanuchus cupido), Henslow’s Sparrow (Ammodramushenslowii), and Savannah Sparrow (Passerculussand- wichensis),indicate that grassland birds are an ancient component of biological diversity on the heavily forested East Coast of North America},

We studied density, body condition, and survivorship of Neotropical migrants, with emphasis on cerulean warbler (Dendroica cerulea), in primary forest and shade coffee plantations in Venezuela. We worked in three primary forest sites and three shade coffee plantations on the western slope of the Cordillera de Mérida of the Andes Mountains. At each site, we surveyed migrants with distance-based line transects and mist-netted and banded migrants during November–February 2005/06 and 2006/07. In addition, we estimated apparent monthly survival for cerulean warbler based on 29 color-banded individuals. Densities of migrants were 3–14× higher in shade coffee plantations than primary forest sites, even after accounting for differences in detectability. Apparent monthly survival of cerulean warblers was estimated at 97\% and overwinter persistence was similarly high. In addition, cerulean warblers demonstrated high between-season fidelity, with 65\% of the birds banded the first year being resighted during the second year. Interestingly, immature birds returned at nearly half the rate as did adults. Banding data indicated that body condition increased significantly as the season progressed for cerulean warblers, Tennessee warblers (Vermivora peregrina), and American redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla). Collectively, these data provide evidence that shade coffee plantations offer high quality wintering habitat for Neotropical migrants, including cerulean warblers.},

Recent studies of wildlife responses to noise have decisively identified changes in animal behaviors and spatial distributions that are caused by noise. Collectively, this research suggests that spatial extent and intensity of potential noise impacts to wildlife can be studied by mapping noise sources and modeling the propagation of noise across landscapes. Here we present models of energy extraction, aircraft overflight and roadway noise as examples of spatially extensive sources and to present tools available for landscape scale investigations. We focus these efforts in US National Parks (Mesa Verde, Grand Teton and Glacier) to highlight that ecological noise pollution is not a threat restricted to developed areas and that many protected natural areas experience significant noise loads. As a heuristic tool for understanding past and future noise pollution we forecast community noise utilizing a spatially-explicit land-use change model that depicts the intensity of human development at sub-county resolution. For road noise, we transform effect distances from two studies into sound levels to begin a discussion of noise thresholds for wildlife. The spatial scale of noise exposure is far larger than any protected area, and no site in the continental US is free form noise. The design of observational and experimental studies of noise effects should be informed by knowledge of regional noise exposure patterns.},

  abstract = {The timing of migration and migratory steps is highly relevant for fitness. Because environmental conditions vary between years, the optimal time for migration varies accordingly. Therefore, migratory animals could clearly benefit from acquiring information as to when it is the best time to migrate in a specific year. Thus, environmental predictability and variability are fundamental characteristics of migration systems but their relationship and consequence for migratory progression has remained unexplored. We develop a simple dynamic model to identify the optimal migration behaviour in environments that differ in predictability, variability and the number of intermediate stop-over sites. Our results indicate that higher predictability along migration routes enables organisms to better time migration when phenology deviates from its long-term average and thus, increases fitness. Information is particularly valuable in highly variable environments and in the final migration-step, i.e. before the destination. Furthermore, we show that a general strategy for obtaining information in relatively uninformative but variable environments is using intermediate stop-over sites that enable migrants to better predict conditions ahead. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between animal movement and environmental predictability—an important, yet underappreciated factor that strongly influences migratory progression.},

Despite evidence that evolutionary adaptation could mitigate climate change impacts, evolution is rarely integrated into predictive models. Integrating population genomics and environmental data, we identified genomic variation associated with climate across the breeding range of the migratory songbird, yellow warbler (Setophaga petechia). Populations requiring the greatest shifts in allele frequencies to keep pace with future climate change have experienced the largest population declines, suggesting that failure to adapt may have already negatively affected populations. Broadly, our study suggests that the integration of genomic adaptation can increase the accuracy of future species distribution models and ultimately guide more effective mitigation efforts.},

  abstract = {Nearly 300 species of landbirds, whose populations total billions, migrate between the Neotropics and North America. Many migratory populations are in steep decline, and migration is often identified as the greatest source of annual mortality. Identifying birds’ needs on migration is therefore central to designing conservation actions for Nearctic-Neotropical migratory birds; yet migration through the Neotropics is a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of the full annual cycle. Here, we synthesise current knowledge of Neotropical stopover regions and migratory bottlenecks, focusing on long-distance, migratory landbirds that spend the boreal winter in South America. We make the important distinction between “true” stopover—involving multi-day refuelling stops—and rest-roost stops lasting \&amp;lt; 24 hours, citing a growing number of studies that show individual landbirds making long stopovers in just a few strategic areas, to accumulate large energy reserves for long-distance flights. Based on an exhaustive literature search, we found few published stopover studies from the Neotropics, but combined with recent tracking studies, they describe prolonged stopovers for multiple species in the Orinoco grasslands (Llanos), the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (Colombia), and the Yucatan Peninsula. Bottlenecks for diurnal migrants are well described, with the narrowing Central American geography concentrating millions of migrating raptors at several points in SE Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama and the Darién. However, diurnally migrating aerial insectivores remain understudied, and determining stopover/roost sites for this steeply declining group is a priority. Despite advances in our knowledge of migration in the Neotropics, we conclude that major knowledge gaps persist. To identify stopover sites and habitats and the threats they face, we propose a targeted and collaborative research agenda at an expanded network of Neotropical sites, within the context of regional conservation planning strategies.},

Field techniques were standardized in all states. CRP fields consisted of either perennial introduced grasses and legumes (CP1) or perennial native grasses (CP2), and the plant species seeded in CRP fields differed within and among the states. Disturbances to CRP fields included mowing (partial or complete), application of herbicides, and burning. The height, vertical density, and canopy coverage of vegetation in CRP fields were measured in each state; values for these measurements were particularly low in Kansas. Mean annual total bird abundance in CRP fields ranged from 4.9 to 29.3 birds/km of transect. The most abundant species on CRP fields differed among states but included red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum), and dickcissels (Spiza americana). Although the total number of bird species was similar in CRP and rowcrop fields across the region, bird abundance was 1.4-10.5 times greater in the former. Nests of 33 bird species were found in CRP fields compared with only 10 species in rowcrop fields, and the number of nests found was 13.5 times greater in CRP fields. Nest success in CRP fields was 40\% overall; predation was the greatest cause of nest failure. Long-term farm set-aside programs that establish perennial grass cover, such as the CRP, seem to provide many benefits for grassland birds, including several species for which conservation is a great concern.}

Paradoxically, V. gouldii populations are higher where Aboriginal hunting is most intense. This effect is driven by an increase in V. gouldii densities near successional edges, which is higher in landscapes that experience extensive human burning. Over time, the positive effects of patch mosaic burning while hunting overwhelm the negative effects of predation in recently burned areas to produce overall positive impacts on lizard populations. These results offer critical insights into the maintenance of animal communities in the desert, supporting the hypothesis that the cur- rent high rate of endemic species decline among small animals may be linked to the interaction between invasive species and mid-century removal of Aboriginal niche construction through hunting and patch mosaic burning.},

  abstract = {The role of ethics is becoming an increasingly important feature of biodiversity conservation dialogue and practice. Compassionate conservationists argue for a prohibition of, or at least a strong presumption against, the adoption of conservation policies that intentionally harm animals. They assert that to be compassionate is to care about animals and that it is antithetical to caring for animals to intentionally harm them. Compassionate conservationists thus criticize many existing conservation practices and policies. Two things together challenge the philosophical foundation of compassionate conservation. First, compassionate conservationists ground their theory in virtue ethics, yet virtue ethics permits exceptions to moral rules, so there cannot be an in-principle prohibition on adopting intentional harm-inducing policies and practices. But not all compassionate conservationists advocate for a prohibition on intentionally harming animals, only a strong presumption against it. This leads to the second point: compassion can motivate a person to adopt a harm-inducing conservation policy or practice when doing so is the best available option in a situation in which animals will be harmed no matter what policy or practice is adopted. Combining these insights with the empirical observation that conservationists regularly find themselves in tragic situations, we arrive at the conclusion that conservationists may regularly advocate for harm-inducing policies and practices from a position of compassion. Article Impact Statement: Compassionate conservationists should accept that the virtuously compassionate person may adopt harm-causing conservation policies.},

I sampled vegetation and counted birds in 90 hayfields of various ages (i.e. number of years since planting) and sizes that were originally planted to a legume-dominated seed mixture. I also resampled a subset of these fields two years later. Over time, these hayfields changed from tall, dense, homogeneous stands of legume-dominated vegetation to short, sparse, patchy stands of grass-dominated vegetation. Fields of all ages were dominated by introduced plant species. Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), the most common bird species breeding in these fields, were most common in fields of intermediate ages, whereas numbers of Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), the second most abundant species, increased logarithmically with field age. Upland Sandpipers (Bartramia longicauda), Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum), and Henslow's Sparrows (A. henslowii) were most abundant in the oldest hayfields, whereas abundances of Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis, the third most common species) did not differ in fields of different ages. Bird-species richness and diversity increased linearly with hayfield age. Three species (Red-winged Blackbird, Bobolink, Savannah Sparrow) accounted for more than 90\% of the breeding individuals. Vegetation structure, composition, and patch size were the most important proximate correlates of habitat selection for these species. Hayfield size was positively correlated with abundance for five of the seven most common species. Furthermore, those species that nested late in the season (Bobolinks, Grasshopper Sparrows, and Henslow's Sparrows) had low breeding densities in fields with early mowing dates the previous year.},

Such a mismatch is primarily expected in avian long-distance migrants because of their complex annual cycle, and in habitats with a seasonal food peak. Here we show that insectivorous long-distance migrant species in The Netherlands declined strongly (1984-2004) in forests, a habitat characterized by a short spring food peak, but that they did not decline in less seasonal marshes. Also, within generalist long-distance migrant species, populations declined more strongly in forests than in marshes. Forest-inhabiting migrant species arriving latest in spring declined most sharply, probably because their mismatch with the peak in food supply is greatest. Residents and short-distance migrants had non-declining populations in both habitats, suggesting that habitat quality did not deteriorate. Habitat-related differences in trends were most probably caused by climate change because at a European scale, long-distance migrants in forests declined more severely in western Europe, where springs have become considerably warmer, when compared with northern Europe, where temperatures during spring arrival and breeding have increased less. Our results suggest that trophic mismatches may have become a major cause for population declines in long-distance migrants in highly seasonal habitats.},

  abstract = {The study evaluates the potential for bird species assemblages to serve as indicators of biological integrity of rangelands in the Great Basin in much the same way that fish and invertebrate assemblages have been used as indicators in aquatic environments. Our approach was to identify metrics of the bird community using relatively simple sampling methods that reflect the degree of rangeland degradation and are consistent over a variety of vegetation types and geographic areas. We conducted the study in three range types (i.e., potential natural plant community types) in each of two widely separated areas of the Great Basin: south-eastern Idaho (sagebrush steppe range types) and west-central Utah (salt-desert shrub range types). Sites were selected in each range type to represent three levels of grazing impact, and in Idaho included sites modified for crested wheatgrass production. Birds were sampled by point counts on 9 100-m radius plots at 250-m spacing on each of 20 sites in each area during the breeding season. In sagebrush-steppe, 964 individuals in 8 species of passerine birds were used in analyses. Five metrics were significantly related to impact class, both when analyzed within range type and when analyzed with all range types combined. Species richness, relative abundance of shrub obligate species, and relative abundance of Brewer's sparrow were generally lower for the higher impact classes, whereas the reverse was true for dominance by a single species and for relative abundance of horned larks. In contrast, total number of individuals did not differ significantly as a function of impact class. In salt-desert shrub, a total of 843 birds in 4 species were included in analyses, 98\% of which were horned larks. None of the metrics identified above was significantly related to impact class. Two metrics for breeding birds in sagebrush steppe (species richness and dominance) showed little overlap between values for the extremes of impact class, and thus they have potential as indicators of biological integrity. However, the sensitivity of these metrics appears to be greatest at the high impact end of the spectrum, which suggests they may have limited utility in distinguishing between sites having light and moderate impact.},

There is no single cause responsible for the declines of grassland birds. Rather, a cumulative set of factors such as afforestation in the eastern United States, fragmentation and replacement of prairie vegetation with a modern agricultural landscape, and large-scale deterioration of western U.S. rangelands are the major causes for these declines. The North American Bird Conservation Initiative (NABCI) is a set of comprehensive and coordinated strategic actions modeled on the Joint Venture initiatives that were used to successfully implement the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. The NABCI is emerging as a potential broad-scale solution for conserving populations of grassland birds. Coordinating grassland bird conservation efforts with initiatives to stabilize and increase upland game birds that have strong affinities for grassland habitats-such as quail and prairie grouse-presents additional opportunities to leverage funding and resources that will positively impact virtually all species of North American grassland birds.

  abstract = {Fire-prone savanna ecosystems in southern African conservation areas are managed by prescribed burning in order to conserve biodiversity. A prescribed burning system designed to maximise the benefits of a diverse fire regime in savanna conservation areas is described. The area burnt per year is a function of the grass fuel load, and the number of fires per year is a function of the percentage area burnt. Fires are point-ignited, under a range of fuel and weather conditions, and allowed to burn out by themselves. The seasonal distribution of planned fires over a year is dependent on the number of fires. Early dry season fires (May–June) tend to be small because fuels have not yet fully cured, while late season fires (August–November) are larger. More fires are ignited in the early dry season, with fewer in the late dry season. The seasonality, area burnt, and fire intensity are spatially and temporally varied across a landscape. This should result in the creation of mosaics, which should vary in extent and existence in time. Envelopes for the accumulated percentage to be burnt per month, over the specified fire season, together with upper and lower buffers to the target area are proposed. The system was formalised after 8 years of development and testing in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa. The spatial heterogeneity of fire patterns increased over the latter years of implementation. This fire management system is recommended for savanna conservation areas of {$>$}20 000 ha in size.},

Our analyses focused on, but were not limited to, censuses of birds recorded in the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Birds and other organisms exhibited a common pattern: each species was represented by only a few individuals in most of the sample sites where it occurred, but was orders of magnitude more abundant in a few "hot spots." The highly clumped frequency distributions of intraspecific abundance among sample sites resemble distributions, such as the negative binomial, canonical lognormal, and broken stick, that have been used to characterize the distribution of abundances among species within local ecological communities. We hypothesize that the spatial variation in abundance largely reflects the extent to which local sites satisfy the niche requirements of a species. Several results are consistent with this hypothesis. First, a computer simulation model in which abundance is determined by the multiplicative combination of several independent environmental variables produces ranked distributions of abundances similar to those observed empirically. Second, geographic patterns of abundance of bird species have been relatively stable over several decades, indicating that different abundances are associated with particular places on the landscape. Third, the abundance of bird species varies in a systematic way over the geographic range, exhibiting positive spatial autocorrelation at small distances and a tendency to increase from the edges toward the center of the range.},

  abstract = {Early hay harvest can negatively affect grassland bird reproduction. Agriculturists may delay harvest in support of grassland bird conservation if hay quality is not jeopardized. We examined changes in hay quality over time at three latitudes in Ontario, and for the central region, we related results to bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) breeding phenology. We collected hay samples at all latitudes from 1 June through 16 July and quantified changes in percent crude protein (CP), acid detergent fibre (ADF), calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P). At the same time, we also monitored breeding behaviour of all grassland birds but sufficient data for analyses and comparative purposes were collected only for bobolinks in central Ontario. Most Ontario hayfields sampled were low in energy and digestibility throughout the growing season (mean ADF values{$>$}35\%). Ca levels were more than adequate for most livestock but P supplementation may be required depending on the production goals of the farmer. Crude protein levels were higher in forage samples collected from northern study plots and fell below 10\% one week later than in central and southern Ontario. In central Ontario, CP levels were highest in the first week of June (12–15\%). In the last two weeks of June through to mid-July, mean CP levels dropped from 11\% to 9.5\%, roughly 0.5\% per week. Fledgling bobolinks were first observed on 14 and 16 June; they were counted in larger numbers after 20 June and reached a peak 1–14 July. A delayed hay harvest (mid-July) in this region would support bobolink reproduction without compromising forage quality for a variety of livestock enterprises. Timing of hay harvest to benefit grassland birds in regions to the north and south may differ depending on local geologic and climatic conditions and breeding bird behaviour. Based on our results, farmers that opt to manage their hayfields in support of grassland birds can delay the timing of hay harvest with trade-offs not as severe as once thought. The delayed hay harvest strategy may have wider applications to agro-ecosystems globally; its feasibility would only require knowledge of local breeding bird activity and forage quality over time.},

We used data collected during fall 2008 and 2009 by 16 WSR-88D radars in the northeastern U.S. to quantify the spatial distribution of landbirds during migratory stopover. We geo-referenced estimates based on radar reflectivity, of the density of migrants aloft at their abrupt evening exodus from daytime stopover sites, to the approximate locations from which they emerged. We classified bird stopover use by the magnitude and variation of radar reflectivity across nights; areas were considered "important" stopover sites for conservation if bird density was consistently high. We developed statistical models that predict potentially important stopover sites across the region, based on land cover, ground elevation, and geographic location. Large areas of regionally important stopover sites were located along the coastlines of Long Island Sound, throughout the Delmarva Peninsula, in areas surrounding Baltimore and Washington, along the western edge of the Adirondack Mountains, and within the Appalachian Mountains of southwestern Virginia and West Virginia. Locally important stopover sites generally were associated with deciduous forests embedded within landscapes dominated by developed or agricultural lands, or near the shores of major water bodies. Preserving or enhancing patches of natural habitat, particularly deciduous forests, in developed or agricultural landscapes and along major coastlines could be a priority for conservation plans addressing the stopover requirements of migratory landbirds in the northeastern U.S. Our maps of important stopover sites can be used to focus conservation efforts and can serve as a sampling frame for fieldwork to validate radar observations or for ecological studies of landbirds on migratory stopover.},

We quantified seasonal densities of nocturnally migrating landbirds during spring and fall of 2011–2015, using two weather radars on the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico (Sabancuy and Cancun). We tested the influence of environmental predictors in explaining broad-scale bird stopover densities.

We found that birds were more concentrated near the coastline in the fall and away from it in spring around Cancun but not Sabancuy. Counter to our expectations, we detected increased bird densities with increased distance from lights in spring around Sabancuy, and in both seasons around Cancun, suggesting avoidance of bright areas during those seasons.

  abstract = {Abstract: Ecological indicators for long-term monitoring programs are needed to detect and assess changing environmental conditions. We developed and tested community-level environmental indicators for monitoring forest bird populations and associated habitat. We surveyed 197 sampling plots in loblolly–shortleaf pine forests, spanning an area from Georgia to Virginia ( U.S.A.) and representing a gradient in levels of anthropogenic disturbance. Ninety of these plots were randomly selected from a sampling grid, permitting quantitative assessment of cumulative distribution functions for bird community and habitat parameters. Species were independently classified into habitat assemblages indicating birds typical of disturbed habitat (e.g., shrubland, forest edge) and undisturbed habitat (mature forest). Relative abundances of these assemblages were used to form a bird community index—similar to the index of biotic integrity applied to aquatic systems—showing the effects of habitat disturbance on forest bird communities. Bird communities on the majority of the sample area (52–75\%, 90\% confidence interval) were dominated by disturbance-tolerant species. Sites dominated by mature-forest species were comparatively uncommon. Habitat assemblages appeared to be particularly useful tools for environmental monitoring; individual species abundance was positively correlated with assemblage species richness, and assemblage members showed consistent responses to variations in disturbance level. To a lesser extent, component species of nesting guilds showed this pattern of cohesive responses, but those of foraging guilds did not. We also developed a habitat index based on habitat variables that predicted bird community index values. Habitat and bird community indices were strongly correlated in an independent validation dataset, suggesting that the habitat index can provide a reliable predictor of bird community status. The two indices may be used in combination, with the bird community index providing a direct measure of the status of the bird community and the habitat index providing a basis on which to separate changes in the bird community into local habitat effects versus other factors (e.g., landscape level effects, changes on wintering grounds).},

This framework unifies ecologists' measures of species diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and distance-based functional diversity. It also provides a unified method of decomposing these diversities and constructing normalized taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional similarity and differentiation measures, including N-assemblage phylogenetic or functional generalizations of the classic Jaccard, Sørensen, Horn, and Morisita-Horn indexes.

Bird species associated with grasslands of southern mixed-grass prairie of North America have declined in abundance, whereas species associated with shrub-stage and woodland habitats have increased. Recent increases in the extent of eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) in the southern Great Plains of North America explain some of the change in bird assemblages in landscapes composed of patches of grassland fragmented by cropland and stands of eastern redcedar. In this study, we determined the influence of eastern redcedar, relative to the influence of structural attributes of the herbaceous layer, on bird assemblages within individual patches of grassland habitat. We indexed bird abundance within the breeding season with point counts on grassland patches with varying levels of invasion of eastern redcedar. Canopy cover of eastern redcedar explained a greater proportion of the composition of bird communities in these grasslands than structure of herbaceous vegetation. Species associated with grassland habitats generally declined in abundance, whereas species associated with shrub and woodland habitats increased as cover of eastern redcedar increased. Perhaps more important to conservation ecology, our data indicate that as canopy cover of eastern redcedar increased, variation in abundance of grassland birds decreased, indicating that canopy cover of eastern redcedar may constrain the local influence of herbaceous habitat structure on bird assemblages.},

Disruption to natural light/dark regimes can have considerable effects on the timing of different behaviours of birds, particularly during the breeding season. However, the effect of artificial lights on the timing of behaviours during winter has received relatively little attention, despite the fact that time partitioning of foraging can have implications for avian winter survival. In this study, we assess at a landscape scale during winter, whether birds arrive at feeding stations earlier in areas with increased levels of artificial lighting using data from a citizen science project. Arrival times of the ten most commonly recorded species were associated with a combination of the density of artificial lights, temperature, rainfall and urban land cover. We found no evidence that birds advance the onset of foraging in gardens with more artificial lights nearby; contrary to our prediction, birds generally arrived later into these areas. This is possibly a response to differences in food availability or predation risk in areas with more artificial lights.We conclude that artificial light at night may not be as important for driving the timing of foraging behaviour in winter as previously thought, but it remains to be seen whether this represents a missed opportunity to extend the foraging period or an adaptive response.},

The necessary elements of compassionate conservation relate to the moral value of sentient animals and conservation and to science and conservation practice. Although compassionate conservation has several nontraditional necessary conditions, it also importantly allows a degree of pluralism in values and scientific judgment regarding animals and conservation practice. We identified 52 specific criticisms from 11 articles that directly critique compassionate conservation. We closely examined 33 of these because they recurred regularly or included substantial questions that required further response. Critics criticized compassionate conservation's ethical foundations, scientific credentials, clarity of application, understanding of compassion, its alleged threat to conservation and biodiversity. Some criticisms, we found, are question begging, confused, or overlook conceptual complexity. These criticisms raise questions for critics and proponents, regarding, for example, equal versus differential intrinsic moral value of different sentient animals (including humans), problems of natural and human-caused suffering of wild animals and predation, and the acceptability of specific conservation practices within compassionate conservation. By addressing recurring and faulty critiques of compassionate conservation and identifying issues for compassionate conservation to address, this review provides a clearer basis for crucial ongoing interdisciplinary dialogue about ethics, values, and conservation.},

It is shown that the E= 0 isocline is a vertical line at X∞=c/[(p- s)q] and that the open access system passes through a supercritical Hopf bifurcation as X∞ moves from a level above (K1+K2)/2 to a level below (K1+K2)/2. For X∞ above (K1+K2)/2 the open access equilibrium is locally stable. For X∞ below (K1+K2)/2 the open access equilibrium will be locally unstable. At X∞=(K1+K2)/2 the system has a stable limit cycle. This analysis is useful in interpreting the economic history of the passenger pigeon. The limited empirical evidence would suggest that X∞=c/[(p – s)q] declined below (K1+K2)/2 during the last half of the 19th century as a result of improved rail transport and communications (the telegraph). It is thought that the passenger pigeon was extinct in the wild by 1901. The last passenger pigeon died in captivity at the Cincinnati Zoological Gardens on September 1, 1914.

  abstract = {We utilized landscape and breeding bird assemblage data from three Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes sampled from 1965–1995 to develop and test a grassland integrity index (GII) in a mixed-grass prairie area of Oklahoma. The overall study region is extensively fragmented from long-term agricultural activity, and native habitat remnants have been degraded by recent encroachment of woody vegetation, namely eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana L.). The 50 individual bird survey points along the BBS routes, known as stops, were used as sample sites. Our process first focused on developing a grassland disturbance index (GDI) as a measure of cumulative landscape disturbances for these sites. The GDI was based on five key landscape variables identified in an earlier species-level study of long-term avian community dynamics: total tree, shrub, and herbaceous vegetation cover indices, overall mean landscape patch size, and grassland patch core size. The GII was then developed based on breeding bird assemblage data. Assemblages were based on commonly used response guilds reflective of five avian life history parameters: foraging mode/location, nesting location, habitat specificity, migratory pattern, and dietary guild. We tested the response of 78 candidate assemblage metrics to the GDI, and eliminated those with no or poor response or with high correlations (redundant), resulting in 13 metrics for use in the final index. Individual metric scores were scaled to fall between 0 and 10, and the cumulative index to range from 0 to 100. Although broader application and refinement are possible, the avian-based GII has an advantage over labor-intensive, habitat-based monitoring in that the GII is derived from readily available long-term BBS data. Therefore, the GII shows promise as an inexpensive tool that could easily be applied over other areas to monitor changes in regional grassland conditions.},

  abstract = {M ercury is a persistent contaminant that biomagnifies up the food web, caus-ing mortality, reproductive failure, and other health effects in predatory wildlife and humans (1, 2). From 1930 to 1950, industrial mer-curic sulfate entered the South River, a tributary of the Shenandoah River in Virginia (United States) (3). To determine whether this mercury contamina-tion had moved into the adjacent terrestrial food web, we analyzed total mercury concentrations in blood from adults of 13 terrestrial-feeding bird species breeding within 50 m of the river (4). We compared these to breeding adults of the same species at uncontaminated reference sites (Fig. 1A). Twelve species had significantly higher mercury than that found in individuals from reference sites (Fig. 1B and table S1). We simultaneously sampled adults of five bird species with direct dietary con-nections to the aquatic mercury; their mercury con-centrations were also significantly elevated relative to reference birds (Fig. 1B and table S1). With the exception of a duck species, all aquatic birds had blood mercury ranging from 2 to 4 parts per million (ppm) (wet weight), about the level of adverse ef-fects (5). Two terrestrial songbirds species, a wren and a vireo, had the highest blood mercury levels of any species, and a majority of terrestrial-feeding birds were in the same range as aquatic-feeding species. We simultaneously sampled feathers of three non-migratory terrestrial species that had molted locally about a year earlier. Whereas blood mercury reflects recent dietary intake, feathers indicate cumulative ex-posure; mercury can only enter feathers while they are growing and connected to the blood supply. Wrens (Thyrothorus ludovicianus) averaged 8.76 ± 6.46 (SD) ppm (n = 6), compared with 5.63 ± 2.12 ppm for owls (n = 5) and 2.38 ± 1.31 ppm for woodpeckers (n = 10), all about twice the level of blood mercury. We collected prey delivered to nestlings of three songbird species at all of the contaminated study sites. None of the diet items was aquatic in origin. The most prevalent items in all three bird species' diets were members of the orders Araneae (spiders), Lepidoptera (moths or caterpillars), and Orthopterae (grasshoppers). Together these comprised {$>$}80\% of the biomass (fresh weight) delivered to nestlings (Fig. 1C). All three terrestrial birds ate diets of \textasciitilde 20 to 30\% spider biomass. Average total mercury concentration in spiders (n = 101) was 1.24 ± 1.47 ppm dry weight, compared with only 0.38 ± 2.08 ppm for lepidop-terans (n = 137) and 0.31 ± 1.22 ppm for orthopterans (n = 50). Invertebrates collected similarly on reference sites contained negligible mercury (spiders, 0.05 ± 0.03 ppm, n = 25; lepidopterans, 0.02 ± 0.64 ppm, n = 20; orthopterans, all below detection limit, n = 6). Much of the mercury in the spiders was in the form of highly bioavailable methylmercury (49 ± 21\%, n = 30), whereas invertebrates lower in the food web had less methylmercury (lepidopterans 24 ± 20\%, n = 22; orthopterans 38 ± 24\%, n = 35), consistent with other reports (6). The spiders at our study site had higher total mercury than fish col-lected from kingfishers at the site (contaminated fish 0.73 ± 1.76 ppm dry weight, n = 21; reference fish, 0.15 ± 0.09 ppm, n = 18), consistent with our observation that some terrestrial songbirds had higher mercury levels than fish-eating kingfishers. These results show that any risk from mercury faced by the river's aquatic birds exists for birds in adjacent terrestrial habitats as well. By preying on predatory invertebrates such as spiders, songbirds increased the length of their food chains, increasing the opportunity for biomagnification. To assess the potential risk of aquatic mercury moving into terres-trial food webs, it is imperative to determine whether the methylmercury we observed in predatory in-vertebrates was transported directly to the terrestrial food web by emergent aquatic insects or had been deposited on the floodplain during historical floods.}

How effective are public grasslands, relative to private lands, for conserving native songbird populations? I compare private and public lands in southern Minnesota using bird survey data from Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) fields and public lands and assessing fragmentation in a GIS. Bird abundance and diversity were greater on CRP lands. Vegetation composition, field isolation, and field size appear to explain differences in bird counts. Land cover data show that grassland habitat on public lands is scarce and widely scattered. The CRP provides more, and here better, habitat for grassland birds. Funding partly explains this disparity. Trends in farm set-aside program rules and distribution, which can be vary greatly over time, will strongly influence the success or failure of biodiversity conservation in this region.},

  abstract = {Ecologists increasingly recognize that birds can respond to features well beyond their normal areas of activity, but little is known about the relative importance of landscapes and proximate factors or about the scales of landscapes that influence bird distributions. We examined the influences of tree cover at both proximate and landscape scales on grassland birds, a group of birds of high conservation concern, in the Sheyenne National Grassland in North Dakota, USA. The Grassland contains a diverse array of grassland and woodland habitats. We surveyed breeding birds on 2015 100 m long transect segments during 2002 and 2003. We modeled the occurrence of 19 species in relation to habitat features (percentages of grassland, woodland, shrubland, and wetland) within each 100-m segment and to tree cover within 200-1600 m of the segment. We used information-theoretic statistical methods to compare models and variables. At the proximate scales, tree cover was the most important variable, having negative influences on 13 species and positive influences on two species. In a comparison of multiple scales, models with only proximate variables were adequate for some species, but models combining proximate with landscape information were best for 17 of 19 species. Landscape-only models were rarely competitive. Combined models at the largest scales (800-1600 m) were best for 12 of 19 species. Seven species had best models including 1600-m landscapes plus proximate factors in at least one year. These were Wilson's Phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor), Sedge Wren (Cistothorus platensis), Field Sparrow (Spizella pusilla), Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), Bobolink (Dolychonix oryzivorus), Red-winged Blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), and Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater). These seven are small-bodied species; thus larger-bodied species do not necessarily respond most to the largest landscapes. Our findings suggest that birds respond to habitat features at a variety of scales. Models with only landscape-scale tree cover were rarely competitive, indicating that broad-scale modeling alone, such as that based solely on remotely sensed data, is likely to be inadequate in explaining species distributions.},

The establishment of protected areas has been used as a conservation action to maintain or help in the recovery of these populations; however, the effectiveness of protected areas in safeguarding bird populations within their borders from negative impacts to populations in surrounding unprotected areas has rarely been evaluated. Our study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of protected areas in the San Francisco Bay Area of California for landbirds. We conducted point count surveys along riparian corridors in coastal Marin County in protected areas, predominately national parks, and estimated the population growth rates for 14 species over 23 years. We compared these growth rates to North American Breeding Bird Survey growth rate estimates from the Coastal California and the Northern Pacific Rainforest Bird Conservation Regions, which comprise larger, regional populations. A safeguarding effect was detected for 9 of the 14 species. We expected an effect on species strongly associated with riparian vegetation, which has incurred significant loss and degradation in the region; however, we instead observed benefits to general riparian users that were at least as great as the benefits to strong riparian specialists. We also expected that populations of resident species might benefit more than migrants; however, we found strong support for a safeguarding effect for both groups. Species with increasing growth rates in coastal Marin County protected areas in comparison to regionally stable or decreasing populations demonstrate the potential for protected areas to not only maintain populations despite declines outside their boundaries but also to help them recover from current and previous losses. Continuing long-term monitoring and associated full life cycle research will help identify if and when other drivers (e.g., climate change) may weaken these safeguarding effects, or when additional conservation and management is warranted.},

  abstract = {Knowing how species respond to fire regimes is essential for ecologically sustainable management. This axiom raises two important questions: (1) what knowledge is the most important to develop and (2) to what extent can current research methods deliver that knowledge? We identify three areas of required knowledge: (i) a mechanistic understanding of species’ responses to fire regimes; (ii) knowledge of how the spatial and temporal arrangement of fires influences the biota; and (iii) an understanding of interactions of fire regimes with other processes. We review the capacity of empirical research to address these knowledge gaps, and reveal many limitations. Manipulative experiments are limited by the number and scope of treatments that can be applied, natural experiments are limited by treatment availability and confounding factors, and longitudinal studies are difficult to maintain, particularly due to unplanned disturbance events. Simulation modelling is limited by the quality of the underlying empirical data and by uncertainty in how well model structure represents reality. Due to the constraints on large-scale, long-term research, the potential for management experiments to inform adaptive management is limited. Rather than simply recommending adaptive management, we define a research agenda to maximise the rate of learning in this difficult field. This includes measuring responses at a species level, building capacity to implement natural experiments, undertaking simulation modelling, and judicious application of experimental approaches. Developing ecologically sustainable fire management practices will require sustained research effort and a sophisticated research agenda based on carefully targeting appropriate methods to address critical management questions.},

Yet, there has been little discussion of the importance of conserving temperate wintering habitat for landbirds, including the billions of Neotemperate migratory landbirds that winter in the United States. The value and impact of conservation initiatives in the U.S. could be maximized by accommodating the habitat requirements of bird communities throughout the full annual cycle, particularly in the southern and western U.S. where winter species richness is concentrated. To estimate the degree to which winter bird communities should be a conservation priority, we examined the temporal distribution of avian diversity using riparian habitat in the lower Cosumnes River and lower Putah Creek watersheds in California’s Central Valley. We used hierarchical multispecies occupancy models to estimate seasonal species richness and phylogenetic diversity in each watershed. We found that total species richness was equally as high in winter as in summer, and that phylogenetic diversity was higher in winter, with a considerable proportion of the winter avian diversity attributable to boreal- breeding Neotemperate migrants. Our results provide evidence that maintaining and restoring high-quality riparian habitat for winter bird communities in California is an important conservation opportunity. Broader recognition of the diversity of temperate winter bird communities and additional research into the factors affecting body condition and survival would facilitate effective conservation of high-quality winter habitat, benefiting Neotemperate migrants and year-round residents during a season that can have important impacts on their population dynamics.},

One such approach is to monitor a single species that serves as an indicator of management effectiveness. The grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum) is an obligate species of dry, upland prairie that has been proposed as a surrogate species for the Eastern Tallgrass Prairie, USA. To evaluate whether this species (or another) would make a suitable indicator for grassland birds, we examined the strength of associations in the density and occurrence of grasshopper sparrows and densities of other grassland species: sedge wren (Cistothorus platensis), Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), Henslow's sparrow (A. henslowii), dickcissel (Spiza americana), bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), and western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta). No single species was a good predictor for all other species, but grasshopper sparrow density was the best predictor of the densities of other obligate upland prairie species. We also compared avian community composition between grassland sites with and without grasshopper sparrows; densities of all species except sedge wren were significantly higher at sites with grasshopper sparrows. Therefore, the grasshopper sparrow is the best choice as a single indicator species for tallgrass prairies within our study area. However, a better approach would be to select multiple, complementary indicator species to ensure that species not well-indicated by grasshopper sparrows are adequately represented. © 2018 The Wildlife Society.},

We tracked the migratory movements of imidacloprid-exposed songbirds at a landscape scale using a combination of experimental dosing and automated radio telemetry. Ingestion of field-realistic quantities of imidacloprid (1.2 or 3.9 milligrams per kilogram body mass) by white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys) during migratory stopover caused a rapid reduction in food consumption, mass, and fat and significantly affected their probability of departure. Birds in the high-dose treatment stayed a median of 3.5 days longer at the site of capture after exposure as compared with controls, likely to regain fuel stores or recover from intoxication. Migration delays can carry over to affect survival and reproduction; thus, these results confirm a link between sublethal pesticide exposure and adverse outcomes for migratory bird populations.},

  abstract = {s Abstract The literature on effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity is huge. It is also very diverse, with different authors measuring fragmentation in different ways and, as a consequence, drawing different conclusions regarding both the magnitude and direction of its effects. Habitat fragmentation is usually defined as a landscape-scale process involving both habitat loss and the breaking apart of habitat. Results of empirical studies of habitat fragmentation are often difficult to interpret because (a) many researchers measure fragmentation at the patch scale, not the landscape scale and (b) most researchers measure fragmentation in ways that do not distinguish between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se, i.e., the breaking apart of habitat after controlling for habitat loss. Empirical studies to date suggest that habitat loss has large, consistently negative effects on biodiversity. Habitat fragmentation per se has much weaker effects on biodiversity that are at least as likely to be positive as negative. Therefore, to correctly interpret the influence of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity, the effects of these two components of fragmentation must be measured independently. More studies of the independent effects of habitat loss and fragmentation per se are needed to determine the factors that lead to positive versus negative effects of fragmentation per se. I suggest that the term "fragmen-tation" should be reserved for the breaking apart of habitat, independent of habitat loss.},

  abstract = {Aim: A common assumption in fire ecology and management is that landscapes with a greater diversity of fire-ages will support a greater diversity of animal species (i.e. 'pyrodiversity begets biodiversity'). This assumption is based on the idea that landscapes with a more diverse fire history provide a greater array of post-fire habitats, leading to a greater number of species within the landscape. We assessed the hypothesis that pyrodiversity begets biodiversity by enhancing community differentiation (β diversity), resulting in increased landscape-scale richness (γ-diversity). We used reptiles as a case-study. Location: The Mallee region of south-eastern Australia. Methods: We used a study design in which 'whole' fire mosaics (12.6 km2) were the unit of replication. Study landscapes (n = 28) were selected to represent a gradient in the diversity and extent of fire-age classes. We surveyed reptiles by using pitfall traps at 10 sites within each landscape (280 sites in total). Reptile data were used to characterize reptile assemblages at the landscape-scale in three ways: alpha (average within-site diversity), beta (between-site diversity) and gamma diversity (total diversity). Results: The diversity of fire-age classes had little influence on the alpha, beta or gamma diversity of reptile assemblages. The properties of fire mosaics that most influenced assemblages were the extent of structurally important fire-age classes. The extent of long-unburned vegetation increased beta diversity but reduced alpha diversity of the total reptile assemblage, essentially cancelling each other out at the landscape scale. Main conclusions: This study highlights the importance of considering multiple measures of diversity when exploring the influence of landscape properties on biodiversity, as 'null' results at the landscape scale (gamma diversity) can result from contrasting patterns in alpha and beta diversity. Using fire to create habitat mosaics, at the scale of this study, is unlikely to enhance the status of reptiles in the region. © 2014 John Wiley \&amp; Sons Ltd.},

We developed a directed dynamic occupancy study and utilized avian database information from the North American Breeding Bird Survey to understand occupancy-habitat associations of bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna) and dickcissel (Spiza americana) in the Black Belt Region of the Upper East Gulf Coastal Plain Joint Venture to inform regional conservation planning. Our results indicate grassland connectivity and landscape composition are important habitat factors to consider on multiple scales for multi-species conservation.  Also, the use of avian database sources is variable and prior considerations should be considered before applying data to occupancy modeling techniques.},

There are a number of assumptions implicit in establishing buffer zones that are typically based on how animals respond to approaching humans. Conventional wisdom suggests that animals will be more sensitive to directly approaching humans than humans approaching tangentially. Visibility and detectability are important factors influencing a species’ response to an approaching threat. Grasslands are an ideal system to study the different approach types because visibility is similar in all directions. We focused on five species of birds, four of them endemic, in the high Pampa de Achala mountain grassland of Argentina to study the effects of direct and tangential approaches on disturbance, and to evaluate five methods typically used to estimate buffer areas considering their sensitivity to the type of approach and their ability to estimate areas large enough to ensure the protection of the target species. We found that, contrary to conventional wisdom, four out of the five species showed greater flight initiation distance response to tangential rather than direct approaches, and that the minimum approach distance and buffer area estimates for these species varied significantly (in some cases an order of magnitude) between methods. Variability in the estimates between methods could be related to their different assumptions, which are not typically evaluated. More generally, we should be cautious when asserting that a buffer area calculated from direct approaches necessarily eliminates human disturbance.},

Recent developments in radar technology have provided powerful tools for investigating on a broad scale migrant use of military installations; thus providing an opportunity to improve both conservation and flight safety measures. In this study, spring and fall migrant use of 40 military installations across the United States were qualitatively investigated. These times of year were selected since they are the periods when BASH is of most concern. Migratory patterns on three installations (Eglin Air Force Base, FL; Ft. Polk, LA; and Yuma Proving Ground, AZ) were then closely examined and migration forecast models for those locations were developed with the goal of providing a tool for reducing the probability of collisions between birds and military aircraft. A comparison was also made between radar estimates of migrant densities aloft during exodus events and more traditional ground-based surveys to evaluate the effectiveness of estimating migrant abundance in stopover habitat with radar data. At Fort Polk, movement ecology and migrant-habitat relations of the Red-eyed Vireo were investigated during migratory stopover. Lastly, migrant use of diverse riparian habitats was compared along water courses near the Yuma Proving Ground. Results indicated that approximately half of the installations examined with radar data contained migrant stopover “hotspots,” reaffirming the fact that military installations are important to migrating birds. Interestingly, migrant abundances, and species turnover as estimated by ground-based surveys, were found to be poorly reflected migrant densities estimated with radar data. Migrant abundance, species richness, and community composition were all also found to be influenced by riparian vegetation composition. This information collectively suggested that radar data can be used to identify migratory hotspots on military installations and improve flight safety on installations with an aviation mission. However, radar data may not be sufficient to distinguish fine-scale differences in habitat use by migrants within an installation’s boundaries.},

Although the number of studies examining grassland-bird habitat selection has increased substantially in recent years, much uncertainty exists regarding local-scale habitat variables that researchers should consider. We reviewed 57 studies and identified important vegetation features correlated with grassland bird abundance, density, occurrence, and nest and territory selection. Our objectives were to 1) guide future studies of grassland-bird habitat use by providing a reduced set of relevant vegetation characteristics, 2) challenge researchers to critically think about what variables to consider, and 3) highlight the need to include consistent definitions of terms used to describe grassland bird habitat. We identified 9 variables that were important predictors of habitat use by grassland birds: coverage of bare ground (important in 50\% of the instances where it was included), grass (34\% of instances), dead vegetation (33\% of instances), forbs (31\% of instances), and litter (29\% of instances), along with an index of vegetation density (39\% of instances) and volume (39\% of instances), litter depth (36\% of instances), and vegetation height (41\% of instances). Only 25\% of studies provided information on effects sizes and measures of variance. Furthermore, definitions of measured habitat variables were not consistent among studies. We provide definitions of the 9 important variables and implore authors to report effect size and measures of variance. Standardization of terms and reporting of meaningful results will facilitate replication of wildlife research and enhance our ability to recognize general patterns that emerge from observational studies of habitat use.},

We used point count and playback surveys to detect Black-backed Woodpeckers during 2011 - 2013 on 460 transects on 10 national forest units. We defined green forest as areas that had not burned at moderate or high severity since 1991 and were more than 2 km from areas burned at moderate or high severity within the previous eight years (n = 386 transects). We used occupancy models to examine green forest habitat associations and found positive relationships with elevation, latitude, northern aspects, number of snags, tree diameter, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest, and a negative relationship with slope. Estimated occupancy in green forest was higher than previously understood (0.21). In addition site colonization and extinction probability in green forest were low (0.05 and 0.19, respectively) and suggest that many of the individuals detected in green forest were not just actively dispersing across the landscape in search of burned areas, but were occupying relatively stable home ranges. The association with high elevation and lodgepole pine forest may increase their exposure to climate change as these elevation forest types are predicted to decrease in extent over the next century. Although density is high in burned forest, green forest covers significantly more area in the Sierra Nevada and should be considered in efforts to conserve this rare species.},

Pronounced antioxidant activity of C. umbellata crude extract was also identified using the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) assay, suggesting this phytomedicine has an antioxidant function in wound healing. A chemical-genetic profile was completed with chimaphilin using ∼4700 S. cerevisiae gene deletion mutants. Cellular roles of deleted genes in the most susceptible mutants and secondary assays indicate that the targets for chimaphilin include pathways involved in cell wall biogenesis and transcription.},

  abstract = {Aim Protected areas (PAs) are the mainstay of our conservation strategies. While they may succeed in locally preventing species and habitat degradation due to human activities, their ability to mitigate the impacts of climate change on biodiversity is still debated. We assessed whether community and species responses to climate change were related to PAs by testing three main predictions: (1) the thermal adjustment of community composition to temperature changes should be positively related to the proportion of PAs, (2) the species that benefit most from PAs should be less impacted by temperature change, and (3) the species a priori considered the most vulnerable to global change should be even more sensitive to the mitigating effect of PAs. Location Mainland France. Methods Data from a long-term, large-scale standardized monitoring programme, recording annual changes in the abundance of 116 breeding bird species in France between 2001 and 2012, were used. Local temporal trends in spring temperature, community reshuffling and bird populations over the country were estimated with a moving window approach (2094 spatial windows). Generalized additive mixed models were then performed to relate these responses to the local proportion of PAs. Results Most PAs promote community adjustment to temperature changes. At the species scale, our results show that the more a species benefited from PAs, the less vulnerable it was to temperature changes. PAs were also more effective in mitigating the impact of climate change on the less common and northernmost birds. Main conclusion Protected areas do seem to mitigate climate change impacts on species and communities. Our study argues for the use of integrative frameworks at different biological scales to assess the usefulness and relevance of PAs faced with climate change and suggests that PAs remain key effective conservation strategies in a changing climatic world.},

  abstract = {Populations of most avian species associated with grasslands have declined in North America over the last few decades. These declines may be related, in part, to changes in species composition and management of pastures and hayfields. The incorporation of native, warm-season grasses into pasture and hayfield management has been suggested as a means of providing suitable habitat for birds in agricultural areas. To examine this, we compared avian abundance, richness, and reproductive success in warm- [i.e. switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii)] and cool-season grass [i.e. orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata)] fields on private farms in southwest Pennsylvania. Point counts, nest monitoring, and vegetation sampling were conducted on nine pairs (warm- and cool-season grass) of fields in 1996, and 12 pairs of fields in 1997. Compared with cool-season grass fields, warm-season grass fields supported a greater abundance and richness of birds, including several declining species [e.g. song sparrows (Melospiza melodia), field sparrows (Spizella pusilla), chipping sparrows (Spizella passerina), grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum), and vesper sparrows (Pooccetes gramineus)]. Additionally, due to lower nest destruction and depredation rates, birds in warm-season grass fields had greater nest success and fledge rates. The positive response of birds to the use of warm-season grasses in pastures and hayfields appears to be due to the increased availability of undisturbed cover. Thus, the establishment of warm-season grasses in pastures and hayfields should be an avian conservation and management priority. Convincing farmers to use warm-season grasses in their fields should not be difficult, as several state and federal programs fund their establishment, and the use of these grasses increases forage production and farm income.},

  abstract = {Differences in life-history traits between tropical and temperate lineages are often attributed to differences in their climatic niche dynamics. For example, the more frequent appearance of migratory behaviour in temperate-breeding species than in species originally breeding in the tropics is believed to have resulted partly from tropical climatic stability and niche conservatism constraining tropical species from shifting their ranges. However, little is known about the patterns and processes underlying climatic niche evolution in migrant and resident animals. We evaluated the evolution of overlap in climatic niches between seasons and its relationship to migratory behaviour in the Parulidae, a family of New World passerine birds. We used ordination methods to measure seasonal niche overlap and niche breadth of 54 resident and 49 migrant species and used phylogenetic comparative methods to assess patterns of climatic niche evolution. We found that despite travelling thousands of kilometres, migrants tracked climatic conditions across the year to a greater extent than tropical residents. Migrant species had wider niches than resident species, although residents as a group occupied a wider climatic space and niches of migrants and residents overlapped extensively. Neither breeding latitude nor migratory distance explained variation among species in climatic niche overlap between seasons. Our findings support the notion that tropical species have narrower niches than temperate-breeders, but does not necessarily constrain their ability to shift or expand their geographical ranges and become migratory. Overall, the tropics may have been historically less likely to experience the suite of components that generate strong selection pressures for the evolution of migratory behaviour.},

Stopovers demand more time than flying and are used by individuals to refuel during migration, but the effect of fuel loads (fat) acquired at stopover sites on the subsequent pace of migration has not been quantified. We studied stopover behaviour of Grey-cheeked Thrush (Catharus minimus) at a site in northern Colombia and then tracked their migration using an intercontinental radio-telemetry array. Tracking confirmed long-distance flights of more than 3000 km, highlighting the key importance of a single stopover site to the migration strategy of this species. Our results suggest that these songbirds behave as time-minimizers as predicted by optimal migration theory, and that fuel loads acquired at this South American stopover site, together with departure date, carry-over to influence the pace of migration, contributing to differences in travel time of up to 30 days in birds subsequently detected in the U. S. and Canada. Such variation in the pace of migration arising from a single stopover site, likely has important fitness consequences and suggests that identifying important fuelling sites will be essential to effectively conserve migratory species.},

We detail a comprehensive measure of overall ecosystem integrity, the bird community index, and demonstrate how it relates to the underlying habitat structure. We use community bird data collected from point counts to generate a single, comprehensive metric that we show is significantly correlated to habitat features, making it an effective tool for evaluating ecological integrity. Next, using the metric, we compare bird communities within and outside of protected status, and find that National Parks maintain higher integrity bird communities. This result provides evidence that even smaller parks in highly urbanized areas afford a conservation benefit. More broadly, we find that this rapid and cost effective assessment tool, the bird community index, shows great promise in helping land managers evaluate protected areas.},

They act systemi-cally, travelling through plant tissues and protecting all parts of the crop, and are widely applied as seed dressings. As neurotoxins with high toxicity to most arthropods, they provide effective pest control and have numerous uses in arable farming and horticulture. 2. However, the prophylactic use of broad-spectrum pesticides goes against the long-established principles of integrated pest management (IPM), leading to environmental concerns. 3. It has recently emerged that neonicotinoids can persist and accumulate in soils. They are water soluble and prone to leaching into waterways. Being systemic, they are found in nectar and pollen of treated crops. Reported levels in soils, waterways, field margin plants and floral resources overlap substantially with concentrations that are sufficient to control pests in crops, and commonly exceed the LC 50 (the concentration which kills 50\% of individuals) for beneficial organisms. Concentrations in nectar and pollen in crops are sufficient to impact substantially on colony reproduction in bumblebees. 4. Although vertebrates are less susceptible than arthropods, consumption of small numbers of dressed seeds offers a route to direct mortality in birds and mammals. 5. Synthesis and applications. Major knowledge gaps remain, but current use of neonicoti-noids is likely to be impacting on a broad range of non-target taxa including pollinators and soil and aquatic invertebrates and hence threatens a range of ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {-Populations of migrant warblers were correlated with populations of lepidopterous larvae in spring in a heavily forested area of southern Illinois. The birds appeared to feed entirely on these larvae, mostly taken from oaks. Estimates of gross calorie intake indicated a positive energy balance for warblers in an area with larval biomass of 0.70 g per m3, and a negative balance in an area with biomass of 0.02 g per m3. Warblers chose either the smaller size classes (under 15 mm) of larvae, or the smaller species (especially leafrollers) out of proportion to their availability, but the birds' positive energy balance was de-pendent upon an irruption of geometrids. Lepidopterous larvae constituted 75-98\% of the available foliage invertebrates, and other groups were insufficient alone to support migrant populations. Larvae were about 80\% water, and warblers ingested 1.2-1.7 times their own weight in larvae per day in order to attain gross caloric intake of 14.8-19.0 kcal per bird-day. Warblers in an area with insufficient food resources ingested 7.2 kcal/day, and their behavior was consistent with a goal of energy conservation. Among the problems faced by migrants after a flight is that of finding adequate food supplies to continue the migration, particularly as the landing area may be completely unknown to the birds. In Illinois the only measurements of migrant populations in forest habitat have been those of Twomey (1945) and Calef (1953) who found four to eight times more birds in elm-maple forest at the peak of migration in May than were present in June. We wondered how the forest accommodated large numbers of mi-grants, and how much forest is required by arboreal migrants. Kendeigh' s (1979) study of invertebrates in three east-central Illinois study areas showed the seasonal population patterns of various groups of invertebrates. There was a close similarity between the timing of emer-gence of lepidopterous larvae and the seasonal timing of bird migration in this region. Stimulated by these papers and the question of how migrant populations respond to habitat availability, we began, in 1979, concurrent studies of bird populations and their potential food resources in (1) an area where forest tracts were extensive, and (2) an area where forest was much more restricted. Our primary goal was to consider the availability of food sup-plies to migrant warblers. Our interest was not in the influence of bird populations on insect populations, but the reverse. In either case, it is important to know about rates of predation. When the opportunity arose in May 198 1 to study food consumption by warblers on in-vertebrates in forest-edge habitat at two widely divergent population levels, we interrupted our principal study to make the observations re-ported here.}

  abstract = {World food demand is expected to more than double by 2050. Decisions about how to meet this challenge will have profound effects on wild species and habitats. We show that farming is already the greatest extinction threat to birds (the best known taxon), and its adverse impacts look set to increase, especially in developing countries. Two competing solutions have been proposed: wildlife-friendly farming (which boosts densities of wild populations on farmland but may decrease agricultural yields) and land sparing (which minimizes demand for farmland by increasing yield). We present a model that identifies how to resolve the trade-off between these approaches. This shows that the best type of farming for species persistence depends on the demand for agricultural products and on how the population densities of different species on farmland change with agricultural yield. Empirical data on such density-yield functions are sparse, but evidence from a range of taxa in developing countries suggests that high-yield farming may allow more species to persist.},

However, specific conservation behavior outcomes following landowner participation in a conservation research program, as well as the drivers that influence their engagement in these behaviors, remain unclear. We interviewed landowners that had provided property access to a Smithsonian conservation research program to conduct ecological research. We investigated (a) how landowners perceived participation in a conservation research program influenced their engagement in conservation behaviors and (b) how landowners perceived characteristics of the program influenced their engagement in conservation behaviors. We found that interviewees' perceived participation in a conservation research program influenced their engagement in land stewardship behaviors more commonly than social environmentalism or environmental citizenship behaviors. Interviewees perceived that program characteristics such as events, on-site survey interactions, and landowner reports most frequently influenced their engagement in conservation behaviors. Our findings suggest that conservation programs may increase their influence on landowner conservation behavior engagement through fostering direct interactions among landowners, their peers, and researchers; training staff and citizen scientists in effective science communication skills; and tailoring program communications to their target audience.},

This study describes the impact of a desexed, free-roaming cat on the behavior of a threatened coastal seabird, the Australian Fairy Tern, Sternula nereis nereis, in Mandurah, south-western Australia. Wildlife cameras and direct observations of cat incursions into the tern colony at night, decapitated carcasses of adult terns, dead, injured or missing tern chicks, and cat tracks and scats around the colony provided strong evidence of cat predation, which led to an initial change in nesting behavior and, ultimately, colony abandonment and the reproductive failure of 111 nests. The death of six breeding terns from the population was a considerable loss for this threatened species and had the potential to limit population growth. This study highlights the significant negative impacts of free-roaming cats on wildlife and the need for monitoring and controlling cats at sites managed for species conservation. It also provides strong evidence against the practice of trap-neuter-release programs and demonstrates that desexed cats can continue to negatively impact wildlife post-release directly through predation, but also indirectly through fundamental changes in prey behavior and a reduction in parental care.},

Based on the sequences of visits to distylous bluets morphs (pins and thrums), and the time spent by a fly at either morph, Bombylius foraged randomly between morphs. This behaviour was probably a result of both morphs being equally abundant and evenly distributed, and an inability of the flies to distinguish between morphs.

  abstract = {Context: Beyond the recognized importance of protecting large areas of contiguous habitat, conservation efforts for many species are complicated by the fact that patch suitability may also be affected by characteristics of the landscape within which the patch is located. Currently, little is known about the spatial scales at which species respond to different aspects of the landscape surrounding an occupied patch. Objectives: Using grassland bird point count data, we describe an approach to evaluating scale-specific effects of landscape composition on patch occupancy. Methods: We used data from 793 point count surveys conducted in idle and grazed grasslands across Wisconsin, USA from 2012 to 2014 to evaluate scale-dependencies in the response of grassland birds to landscape composition. Patch occupancy models were used to evaluate the relationship between occupancy and landscape composition at scales from 100 to 3000~m. Results: Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) exhibited a pattern indicating selection for grassland habitats in the surrounding landscape at all spatial scales while selecting against other habitats. Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna) displayed evidence of scale sensitivity for all habitat types. Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum) showed a strong positive response to pasture and idle grass at all scales and negatively to cropland at large scales. Unlike other species, patch occupancy by Henslow’s Sparrow (A. henslowii) was primarily influenced by patch area. Conclusions: Our results suggest that both working grasslands (pasture) and idle conservation grasslands can play an important role in grassland bird conservation but also highlight the importance of considering species-specific patch and landscape characteristics for effective conservation.},

  abstract = {Compassionate conservation focuses on 4 tenets: first, do no harm; individuals matter; inclusivity of individual animals; and peaceful coexistence between humans and animals. Recently, compassionate conservation has been promoted as an alternative to conventional conservation philosophy. We believe examples presented by compassionate conservationists are deliberately or arbitrarily chosen to focus on mammals; inherently not compassionate; and offer ineffective conservation solutions. Compassionate conservation arbitrarily focuses on charismatic species, notably large predators and megaherbivores. The philosophy is not compassionate when it leaves invasive predators in the environment to cause harm to vastly more individuals of native species or uses the fear of harm by apex predators to terrorize mesopredators. Hindering the control of exotic species (megafauna, predators) in situ will not improve the conservation condition of the majority of biodiversity. The positions taken by so-called compassionate conservationists on particular species and on conservation actions could be extended to hinder other forms of conservation, including translocations, conservation fencing, and fertility control. Animal welfare is incredibly important to conservation, but ironically compassionate conservation does not offer the best welfare outcomes to animals and is often ineffective in achieving conservation goals. Consequently, compassionate conservation may threaten public and governmental support for conservation because of the limited understanding of conservation problems by the general public.},

Fragment area strongly influenced bird communities within grasslands and accounted for a high percentage of the variation in mean breeding bird species richness among fragments (R2 = 0.84). Breeding bird species richness patterns within 4.5—ha subsections of these grasslands also significantly increased with fragment size. Eight of the 15 (53\%) most common bird species had distributions among fragments that were significantly influenced by habitat area, whereas six species (40\%) had distributions within fragments that were significantly influenced by vegetation structure only. The Dickcissel (Spiza americana) was the only species with a distribution within fragments that was not significantly associated with either habitat area or vegetation structure. Four groups of birds were identified by an analysis of habitat area and vegetation structure preferences of individual species: area—sensitive species (5 species), edge species (3), vegetation—restricted species (6), and the Dickcissel. Estimates of minimal area requirements for the five area—sensitive species ranged from 5 to 55 ha. Discriminant analyses of habitat suitability within fragments suggests that the absence of area—sensitive grassland bird species form some small fragments may result, in part, from limited habitat availability. All five area—sensitive species, however, also regularly avoided structurally suitable habitat on small grassland fragments. As a result of the considerable extent to which native and, more recently, agricultural grasslands have declined in the Midwest, habitat fragmentation is likely to have caused midwestern grassland bird declines, especially for area—sensitive species.},

Within agricultural landscapes, set-aside programs may offer the most promising conservation opportunities due to the large area involved in these programs. I explored the relationship between set-aside effect size—on the basis of data from field studies of birds in cropland and set-aside fields—and population changes following establishment of these fields. Species whose abundance was most strongly influenced by the establishment of set-aside lands also tended to show positive changes in population trends following broad-scale implementation of the set-aside program. This relationship was strongest for grassland obligate birds, a group of birds experiencing broad-scale population declines throughout North America. There is now increasing evidence that set-aside lands within the United States are providing population-level benefits to grassland birds. Nevertheless, there are also increasing concerns about the stability of these set-aside lands in the face of increased demand for crops and rising commodity prices. If set-aside area within the United States is allowed to decline, additional declines of birds and perhaps other taxa within agricultural landscapes seem likely.},

  abstract = {The influence of vegetation structure on the probability of daily nest survival (DNS) for grassland passerines has received considerable attention. Some correlative studies suggest that the presence of woody vegetation lowers DNS. Over 3 years (2009–2011), we monitored 215 nests of the Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum) and Henslow's Sparrow (A. henslowii) on 162 ha of reclaimed surface-mine grasslands in Pennsylvania. We removed shrubs from treatment plots with ≤36\% areal coverage of woody vegetation in a before-after-control-impact-pairs (BACIP) design framework. Daily nest survival (95\% CI: 0.94–0.96) was as high as previous studies have reported but was not associated with woody vegetative cover, proximity to woody vegetation, or woody stem density. Variation in DNS was best explained by increasing nonwoody-vegetation height. Grasshopper Sparrow fledgling production on treatment plots in 2010 (95\% CI: 3.3–4.7) and 2011 (95\% CI: 3.8–5.0) was similar to baseline conditions of treatment plots (95\% CI: 3.4–4.9) and control plots (95\% CI: 3.2–4.5) in 2009. Fledgling production was associated with thatch depth (β ± SE = 0.13 ± 0.09) and bare ground (β ± SE = -2.62 ± 1.29) adjacent to the nest and plot woody vegetative cover ( ± SE = -3.09 ± 1.02). Our experimental research suggests that overall reproductive success of Grasshopper and Henslow's sparrows on reclaimed surfacemine grasslands is driven by a suite of largely nonwoody—vegetation components, and both species can successfully nest and produce young in habitats with greater amounts of scattered woody vegetation than has generally been considered.},

  abstract = {Grassland bird species have experienced substantial declines in North America. These declines have been largely attributed to habitat loss and degradation, especially from agricultural practices and intensification (the habitat-availability hypothesis). A recent analysis of North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) "grassland breeding" bird trends reported the surprising conclusion that insecticide acute toxicity was a better correlate of grassland bird declines in North America from 1980-2003 (the insecticide-acute-toxicity hypothesis) than was habitat loss through agricultural intensification. In this paper we reached the opposite conclusion. We used an alternative statistical approach with additional habitat covariates to analyze the same grassland bird trends over the same time frame. Grassland bird trends were positively associated with increases in area of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) lands and cropland used as pasture, whereas the effect of insecticide acute toxicity on bird trends was uncertain. Our models suggested that acute insecticide risk potentially has a detrimental effect on grassland bird trends, but models representing the habitat-availability hypothesis were 1.3-21.0 times better supported than models representing the insecticide-acute-toxicity hypothesis. Based on point estimates of effect sizes, CRP area and agricultural intensification had approximately 3.6 and 1.6 times more effect on grassland bird trends than lethal insecticide risk, respectively. Our findings suggest that preserving remaining grasslands is crucial to conserving grassland bird populations. The amount of grassland that has been lost in North America since 1980 is well documented, continuing, and staggering whereas insecticide use greatly declined prior to the 1990s. Grassland birds will likely benefit from the de-intensification of agricultural practices and the interspersion of pastures, Conservation Reserve Program lands, rangelands and other grassland habitats into existing agricultural landscapes.},

  abstract = {Effective management and conservation of migratory bird populations require knowledge and incorporation of their movement patterns and space use throughout the annual cycle. To investigate the little-known migratory patterns of two grassland bird species, we deployed 180 light-level geolocators on Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) and 29 Argos-GPS tags on Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) at Konza Prairie, Kansas, USA, and six US Department of Defense (DoD) installations distributed across the species' breeding ranges. We analyzed location data from 34 light-level geolocators and five Argos-GPS tags attached for 1~year to Grasshopper Sparrows and Eastern Meadowlarks, respectively. Grasshopper Sparrows were present on the breeding grounds from mid-April through early October, substantially longer than previously estimated, and migrated on average \textasciitilde 2,500~km over \textasciitilde 30~days. Grasshopper Sparrows exhibited strong migratory connectivity only at a continental scale. The North American Great Lakes region likely serves as a migratory divide for Midwest and East Coast Grasshopper Sparrows; Midwest populations (Kansas, Wisconsin, and North Dakota; n~=~13) largely wintered in Texas or Mexico, whereas East Coast populations (Maryland and Massachusetts, n~=~20) wintered in the northern Caribbean or Florida. Our data from Eastern Meadowlarks provided evidence for a diversity of stationary and short- and long-distance migration strategies. By providing the most extensive examination of the nonbreeding movement ecology for these two North American grassland bird species to date, we refine information gaps and provide key insight for their management and conservation.},

During spring migration, as they approach their breeding grounds, passerines may deposit fat in excess of what is needed to complete migration. Individuals may carry excess fuel reserves as insurance against potentially poor environmental conditions in early spring (insurance hypothesis). If this is true, individuals arriving early at northern stopover locations or their breeding grounds should have greater energy reserves than later arrivals. Alternatively, passerines may arrive in spring with excess fat to help offset the demands of breeding (breeding performance hypothesis). Given the energetic requirements of egg production, females may arrive with greater reserves than males if excess fat directly or indirectly offsets breeding costs. We analyzed the energetic condition of 12 warbler species mist-netted during migration from 1999 to 2012 at Braddock B...},

For birds that have a synchronized timing of migration with resource availability, the likelihood that trophic mismatches may generate a phenological response in migration timing increases with climate change5. Despite the importance of a holistic understanding of such systems at large spatial and temporal scales, particularly given a rapidly changing climate, analyses are few, primarily because of limitations in the access to appropriate data. Here we use 24 years of remotely sensed data collected by weather surveillance radar to quantify the response of a nocturnal avian migration system within the contiguous United States to changes in temperature. The average peak migration timing advanced in spring and autumn, and these changes were generally more rapid at higher latitudes. During spring and autumn, warmer seasons were predictive of earlier peak migration dates. Decadal changes in surface temperatures predicted spring changes in migratory timing, with greater warming related to earlier arrivals. This study represents one of the first system-wide examinations during two seasons and comprises measures from hundreds of species that describe migratory timing across a continent. Our findings provide evidence of spatially dynamic phenological shifts that result from climate change.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Invasive mammals are the greatest threat to island biodiversity and invasive rodents are likely responsible for the greatest number of extinctions and ecosystem changes. Techniques for eradicating rodents from islands were developed over 2 decades ago. Since that time there has been a significant development and application of this conservation tool. We reviewed the literature on invasive rodent eradications to assess its current state and identify actions to make it more effective. Worldwide, 332 successful rodent eradications have been undertaken; we identified 35 failed eradications and 20 campaigns of unknown result. Invasive rodents have been eradicated from 284 islands (47,628 ha). With the exception of two small islands, rodenticides were used in all eradication campaigns. Brodifacoum was used in 71\% of campaigns and 91\% of the total area treated. The most frequent rodenticide distribution methods (from most to least) are bait stations, hand broadcasting, and aerial broadcasting. Nevertheless, campaigns using aerial broadcast made up 76\% of the total area treated. Mortality of native vertebrates due to nontarget poisoning has been documented, but affected species quickly recover to pre-eradication population levels or higher. A variety of methods have been developed to mitigate nontarget impacts, and applied research can further aid in minimizing impacts. Land managers should routinely remove invasive rodents from islands {$<$}100 ha that lack vertebrates susceptible to nontarget poisoning. For larger islands and those that require nontarget mitigation, expert consultation and greater planning effort are needed. With the exception of house mice (Mus musculus), island size may no longer be the limiting factor for rodent eradications; rather, social acceptance and funding may be the main challenges. To be successful, large-scale rodent campaigns should be integrated with programs to improve the livelihoods of residents, island biosecurity, and reinvasion response programs.},

  abstract = {Illustration by Kenn Kaufman T HE POPULATIONS OF MANY NEO-tropical migratory bird species have reportedly been declining over the past 20-40 years (Aldrich and Robbins 1970; Walcott 1974; Criswell 1975; Temple and Temple 1976; B. L. Whit-comb et al. 1977; Briggs and Criswell 1979; Robbins 1979; R. F. Whitcomb et al. 1981; Ambuel and Temple 1982; Hall 1984). One factor that has received considerable attention as a cause behind such changes is the destruction of trop-ical forest communities (Briggs and Criswell 1979; Terborgh 1980; Ambuel and Temple 1982; Howe 1983; Lovejoy 1983; Rappole et al. 1983; Hall 1984). In fact, this explanation has already be-come dogma to many, as evidenced by the distillation of such "fact" into the popular press (Webster 1980; Deis 1981; Steinhart 1984). I have had a difficult time reconciling this view with results from my own studies of neotropical migrants that winter in western Mexico where, it seems, most migrants are exceptionally numerous in disturbed habitats (Hutto 1980; Hutto 1988). Because virtually all the evidence for population declines has come from studies of eastern North American migrants, and because the eastern migratory system is geographi-cally distinct from the western system (Barlow 1980; Fitzpatrick 1980; Fitzpa-trick 1982; Keast 1980; Hutto 1985; Hutto 1988), I began to think that per-haps only the eastern migrants were de-dining. In order to repeat the kinds of studies that exposed the declining pop-ulations of migrants in the East, I needed to review the methods used by previous researchers. Volume 42, Number 3 375 Illustrations by Patti Katusic In this paper, I wish to critically eval-uate the sources of information that have been cited as evidence for wide-spread population declines, to evaluate the relative importance of alternative explanations for the reported declines in migrant populations, and to discuss some issues that must be ironed out be-fore an improved monitoring of neo-tropical migrant populations can be re-alized. Are neotropical migratory bird populations declining? The earliest references that have been cited in support of the argument that neotropical migrants are declining are Carson (1962), Aldrich and Robbins (1970), and Vogt (1970). The evidence used by Carson and Vogt was entirely anecdotal. Aldrich and Robbins, how-ever, used data from their preliminary analyses of the then-new Breeding Bird Survey to report that many migrants had decreased "markedly" (no data presented) during the prior 15 years, but they also stated that many other mi-grants did not change, and that still others increased. I think it is safe to say that the evidence is no more than suggestive on the basis of these early publications. Since the mid-1970s, numerous ad-ditional publications based on objective census data have appeared (Walcott 1974; Criswell 1975; Temple and Tem-ple 1976; B.L. Whitcomb et aL 1977; Briggs and Criswell 1979; Robbins 1979; R.F. Whitcomb et al. 1981; Am-bud and Temple 1982; Hall 1984), and these too have become widely cited. Subsequent claims of widespread pop-ulation declines of migrants have been based entirely on extrapolations from these local studies. Furthermore, viable alternative explanations for population declines have been conveniently ig-nored in certain instances where the},

  abstract = {The approach or presence of an observer may affect the behavior of nearby birds, rendering them either more or less detectable than when no observer is present due to a change in singing rates. To test whether there are systematic detection biases associated with the presence of an observer during point count bird surveys, we compared the occurrence and singing rates of birds during a 10-min period immediately preceding the time when an observer arrived to conduct a count and during the formal count itself by extracting song information from autonomous sound recorders. We obtained recordings of 36 species of birds detected at ≥5 locations in one of three vegetation types, including burned conifer forest, green conifer/riparian streamside forest, and riparian bottomland/marshland. We found that species richness and both the probability of occurrence and singing rate for any of the species recorded were unaffected by the presence of an observer. In addition, the probability of occurrence did not differ significantly among four 2.5-min recording sessions during 10-min counts when an observer was present. Thus, the presence of an observer did not appear to introduce any detectable systematic bias that would make bird lists or unadjusted occurrence rates inaccurate on that basis alone. In addition, rates of bird occurrence across 2.5-min temporal subsets of a 10-min count did not vary in a systematic way that would violate the assumption of equal occupancy across adjacent time periods as sometimes used to build detection histories in occupancy modeling.},

We conducted roadside point counts within Delaware, USA, to determine the presence of grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum). We quantified both land cover composition and configuration at local and landscape scales at our survey sites using data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Coastal Change Analysis Program. We determined the spatial scales at which grasshopper sparrow presence was most strongly related to landscape metrics and modeled grasshopper sparrow habitat occupancy at multiple scales, while accounting for variation in detection. At the site scale, occupancy was negatively related to forest and shrub composition. At the landscape scale, grasshopper sparrow occupancy was positively related to the amount of grasslands and pastures, and negatively related to mean inter-patch distance of grasslands and amount of low-intensity development. Our model had good predictive accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve = 0.717).

Using an information-theoretic approach, we found a 34\% reduction in nesting success of Carolina Wrens on mercury-contaminated sites when compared with reference sites. Blood mercury concentration of the attending female was a strong predictor of nest success. Birds nesting on contaminated sites were 3× more likely to abandon their nests than birds on uncontaminated reference sites.

We estimated detection probabilities (p) of river otters using occupancy models in Program PRESENCE. Mean detection probability for a 400-m survey was highest in mud substrates (p = 0.60) and lowest in snow (p = 0.18) and leaf litter substrates (p = 0.27). Scat had a higher detection probability (p = 0.53) than tracks (p = 0.18), and experienced observers had higher detection probabilities (p {$>$} 0.71) than novice observers (p {$<$} 0.55). Detection probabilities increased almost 3-fold as survey length increased from 200 m to 1,000 m, and otter sign was not concentrated near access points.

  abstract = {Birds that depend on grass and shrubland habitats for survival are experiencing a greater decline than any other avian assemblage in North America. Habitat loss and degradation on both breeding and wintering grounds are among the leading causes of these declines, though research on wintering bird communities throughout the Americas is limited. In my dissertation I explored the response of breeding and wintering grassland bird communities to conservation and land management in the eastern US. Using point count survey data collected through a regional citizen science program, Virginia Working Landscapes, I used statistical models to predict breeding grass and shrubland bird abundance based on habitat and landscape composition. Shrubland birds exhibited increased densities in fields managed through the Virginia Quail Recovery Initiative, a targeted habitat program directed towards the conservation of Northern Bobwhites (Colinus virginianus). In contrast, grassland-obligate avian species exhibited higher breeding densities in fields managed as hayfields and pastures. Results indicate that quail habitat management can be promoted as a tool to conserve habitat for early successional songbirds, but not grassland species. However, grassland fragmentation may be influencing the response of grassland birds to quail management and therefore requires further investigation. To explore how these habitats influence avian communities during the non-breeding period, I used transect data to identify differences in wintering species diversity between fields comprised of native warm-season grasses (WSG) and fields comprised of non-native cool-season grasses (CSG). WSG fields had higher species diversity than CSG fields. In addition, timing of field management influenced bird communities, with fields managed in summer or fall months exhibiting lower avian abundance than those managed in the winter or not at all. For my final chapter, I used data collected from a national citizen science program, eBird, to create an occupancy model for a declining grassland bird, the Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus). The occupancy model revealed important species-environment relationships that can be used to predict shrike occurrence throughout the southeastern portion of the US. Though open country habitats were the main driver of occupancy year-round, seasonal changes in distributions were driven by temperature and percent forest cover in the landscape, indicating a potential tradeoff of predation risk for increased cover from harsh weather in winter. The results of this work demonstrate how conservation and land management influence avian communities in eastern grasslands on multiple spatial scales during breeding and non-breeding seasons. These findings can be used to improve best management practices of grasslands to optimize habitat quality for declining species throughout the full annual cycle.},

Conversion of these to effective number of species is the key to a unified and intuitive interpretation of diversity. Effective numbers of species derived from standard diversity indices share a common set of intuitive mathematical properties and behave as one would expect of a diversity, while raw indices do not. Contrary to Keylock, the lack of concavity of effective numbers of species is irrelevant as long as they are used as transformations of concave alpha, beta, and gamma entropies. The practical importance of this transformation is demonstrated by applying it to a popular community similarity measure based on raw diversity indices or entropies. The standard similarity measure based on untransformed indices is shown to give misleading results, but transforming the indices or entropies to effective numbers of species produces a stable, easily interpreted, sensitive general similarity measure. General overlap measures derived from this transformed similarity measure yield the Jaccard index, Sørensen index, Horn index of overlap, and the Morisita–Horn index as special cases.},

Our model captures the main elements of both theories by incorporating the combined effects of area, isolation, stochastic colonization and extinction processes, habitat heterogeneity, and niche partitioning in a unified, demographically based framework. While classical niche theory predicts a positive relationship between species richness and habitat heterogeneity, our unified model demonstrates that area limitation and dispersal limitation (the main elements of island biogeography) may create unimodal and even negative relationships between species richness and habitat heterogeneity. We attribute this finding to the fact that increasing heterogeneity increases the potential number of species that may exist in a given area (as predicted by niche theory) but simultaneously reduces the amount of suitable area available for each species and, thus, increases the likelihood of stochastic extinction. Area limitation, dispersal limitation, and low reproduction rates intensify the latter effect by increasing the likelihood of stochastic extinction. These analytical results demonstrate that the integration of island biogeography and niche theory provides new insights about the mechanisms that regulate the diversity of ecological communities and generates unexpected predictions that could not be attained from any single theory.}

  abstract = {The outcome of the ongoing biodiversity crisis depends on the capacity of the Earth’s wildlife to persist in working landscapes. Yet, the species that occupy working landscapes are often distinct from those in protected areas, with a large group of “sensitive species” thought to rarely venture into human-dominated landscapes. As governments have committed to restoring degraded lands world-wide, determining whether and how working landscapes can be restored to benefit sensitive species remains a major challenge. We surveyed Neotropical birds across Northwestern Costa Rica in protected areas, farms and forests embedded within working landscapes. We analysed community composition to understand how gradients of forest cover, fragmentation and regional precipitation determine how conserving (or restoring) tropical forests in working landscapes could safeguard entire communities, especially sensitive species with limited ranges. We found agricultural sites maintained relatively high bird diversity but hosted very distinct communities from those found in protected areas. The average range size of species found in agricultural communities was double the size of species in protected areas. However, high forest cover sites in working landscapes housed bird communities with small range sizes that were equivalent to those in nearby protected areas, despite being twice as fragmented and significantly more disturbed. The effect of local forest cover on bird composition was contingent on both landscape context and regional climate. When local forest cover increased in wetter regions and more forested landscapes, bird communities in working landscapes exhibited a stronger shift towards the assemblages found in protected areas. Specifically, we found that reforesting the wettest sites would increase similarity to protected areas fourfold compared to only a twofold increase in the driest sites. Synthesis and applications. Despite experiencing much more fragmentation and degradation than protected areas, forests in Costa Rican working landscapes can maintain bird communities that strongly resemble those found in protected areas. This suggests that conserving or restoring forests in working landscapes, particularly within wetter regions and already forested landscapes, may safeguard bird communities when creating protected areas is infeasible.},

To characterize abundance patterns, we used mistnet capture data from spring and fall migration in the Middle Rio Grande Valley, New Mexico, spring migration on the Gulf Coast of Louisiana, and fall migration on the Gulf Coast of Alabama. To describe the summer biogeography of 47 species of wood warblers, we used indices of their summer range size, their summer density, and distance between their summer ranges and our netting sites. Multiple linear regressions indicated that biogeographic indices explained 55\% and 49\% of variation in captures in the Middle Rio Grande Valley during spring and fall, respectively. On the Gulf Coast these regressions explained 25\% of the variation during spring at the Louisiana site and 51\% during fall at the Alabama site. Both summer range size and distance between the summer range and study sites explained significant portions of the variation in three of the four analyses. Interestingly, the importance of biogeographic factors was least evident among spring migrants along the Gulf Coast of Louisiana. The difference between this site and other sites may reflect differences between migrants arriving after a Gulf crossing and those migrating across continental land masses or possibly an increased importance of winter biogeography for migrants crossing the Gulf of Mexico in the spring. In general, these results indicate that abundance of migrant warblers at our netting sites in both the eastern and western United States during spring and fall migration were influenced by summer biogeography. Consequently, we suggest including biogeographic analyses in assessments of conservation priorities for local stopover sites.},

  abstract = {Area sensitivity, species being disproportionately present on larger habitat patches, has been identified in many taxa. We propose that some apparently area-sensitive species are actually responding to how open a habitat patch is, rather than to patch size. We tested this hypothesis for Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) by comparing density and occupancy to a novel openness index, patch area, and edge effects. Bobolink density and occupancy showed significant relationships with openness, but logistic models based on an openness occupancy threshold had greater explanatory power. Thresholds remained approximately consistent from June through August, and shifted to be more open in September. Variance partitioning supported the openness index as unique and relevant. We found no relationships between measures of body condition (body mass, body size, circulating corticosterone levels) and either openness or area. Our findings have implications for studies of area sensitivity, especially with regards to inconsistencies reported within species: specifically, (1) whether or not a study finds a species to be area sensitive may depend on whether small, open sites were sampled, and (2) area regressions were sensitive to observed densities at the largest sites, suggesting that variation in these fields could lead to inconsistent area sensitivity responses. Responses to openness may be a consequence of habitat selection mediated by predator effects. Finally, openness measures may have applications for predicting effects of habitat management or development, such as adding wind turbines, in open habitat. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

With their poor dispersal abilities, their habitats on vegetation and in litter, and their sensitivity to humidity and shade, we expected land snails to be an interesting model to assess short, medium and long-term impact of fires on fauna biodiversity and their resilience. Stratified sampling was carried out on 12 sampling sites in garrigues and forests of Provence (southeastern France), according to fire regime (number of fires, fire intervals and age of the last fire) over the past 30 years. Data were investigated using diversity indexes, Kruskal--Wallis test, dendrogram of affinities and Correspondence Analysis (CA). We found, however, that Mediterranean land snail communities are particularly resilient to fires. Although abundance is drastically reduced in the short-term, species richness and community diversity are preserved provided that the time lapse between two successive fires is longer than the time required for recovery (i.e. around 5 years). This high community resilience in the short-term may be partly due to ecological and ethological aptitudes of land snails. However, these astonishing results, which have implications for conservation biology, are mainly due to the presence, within burned areas, of cryptic refuges that allow initial land snail survival, malacofauna persistence after successive fires and consistent biogeographical patterns in the long-term.},

We investigated continental-scale breeding season associations with ANP for 322 bird species to test whether small-scale predictions related to breeding habitat, migratory behaviour, body mass and vocal traits are consistent at broad spatial extents for an extensive group of species. Location: Conterminous USA. Time period: 2004–2011. Major taxa studied: North American breeding birds. Methods: We calculated, for each species, the association between the breeding season and ANP, using spatially explicit estimates of ANP from the National Park Service and weekly estimates of probabilities of occurrence based on observations from the eBird citizen-science database. We evaluated how the association of the breeding season for each species with ANP was related to expectations based on size, migratory behaviour and breeding habitat. For a subset of species, we used vocal trait data for song duration, pitch and complexity to evaluate hypotheses from the birdsong literature related to habitat complexity and sensitivity to ANP. Results: Species that breed predominantly in anthropogenic environments were associated with twice the level of ANP (\textasciitilde 7.4~dB) as species breeding in forested habitats (\textasciitilde 3.2~dB). However, we did not find evidence to suggest that birds with higher-pitched songs are more likely to be found in areas with higher levels of ANP. Residents and migratory species did not differ in associations with ANP, but songs were less complex among forest-breeding species than non-forest-breeding species and increased in complexity with increasing ANP. Main conclusions: Anthropogenic noise pollution is an important factor associated with breeding distributions of bird species in North America. Vocal traits could be useful to understand factors that affect sensitivity to ANP and to predict the potential impact of ANP, although future studies should aim to understand how and why patterns differ across spatial scales.},

  abstract = {Understanding how biological communities respond to global change is important for the conservation of functioning ecosystems as anthropogenic environmental threats increase. National parks within the United States provide unique ecological and cultural resources that can help conserve biodiversity and maintain ecological integrity, especially in heavily urbanized environments. Parks within the National Capital Region (NCRN) and Mid-Atlantic (MIDN) Networks, representing federally protected areas located within a mixed landscape of rural to urban areas, have been monitoring forest and grassland birds annually to evaluate long-term trends in bird community dynamics. Given increasing rates of decline in forest- and grassland-breeding songbirds in North America, understanding community-level trends in parks will help their preservation for future generations. We used point count data collected between 2007 and 2015 from 640 sampling locations to calculate a bird community index (BCI) to infer relative estimates of ecological integrity. Our objectives were to (1) quantify BCI in 17 national parks in the mid-Atlantic region, (2) test for relationships between BCI and the proportion of forest and developed land cover types, (3) assess temporal variation in BCI, and (4) additionally test for differences in estimates of species detection probability between volunteer citizen scientists and paid observers. Mean BCI scores and ecological integrity ranks among parks ranged between 33.5 (low integrity) and 58.3 (high integrity), while the majority of parks had BCI scores ranging between 40.1 and 52.0 (medium integrity). For both networks, we found that BCI was positively related to the extent of forest cover, and for NCRN, the more heavily urbanized network, we found that BCI was negatively related to developed land cover. Assessment of temporal changes in BCI within parks indicated that BCI was stable for 12 parks, increased in four parks, and decreased in one park within our study. Lastly, we detected no differences in species detection probability between citizen scientist- and paid observer-collected data which lends support for the future comparison of bird monitoring data in regional analyses across NPS I\&M Networks. The continued evaluation of ecological integrity, through measuring bird community dynamics at regional scales, is important for conserving biological diversity.},

  abstract = {Large, intense fires are generators of heterogeneity in many ecosystems. An important component of this heterogeneity is the occurrence of unburnt patches within the fire boundary: these fulfil a number of ecological functions including serving as refuges for fire-sensitive organisms. An important issue for land managers is the degree to which potential refuges occur ‘naturally’ versus occurring as a result of interventions such as planned burning. Here, we examine the factors contributing to the occurrence of unburnt patches within the Kilmore–Murrindindi fire complex, a severe wildfire that encompassed ∼250,000ha and resulted in 159 human fatalities in Victoria, Australia, in 2009. Though an extreme event, this fire is representative of large, intense fires that periodically occur in south-eastern Australia. Unburnt patches ⩾1ha occupied less than 1\% of the area within the fire boundary, with mean size of 27.1ha (range 1–306ha). Overall, the probability of points within the fire boundary remaining unburnt was most strongly influenced by topographic position, vegetation type and fire intensity in the surrounding area. In dry eucalypt forest, time since fire (a surrogate for fuel structure) was also important. The influence of all factors was strongly contingent on prevailing weather during the fire, with no unburnt patches occurring in extreme fire conditions. In this fire, most unburnt patches arose ‘naturally’ due to microclimatic effects of topography and vegetation. While fuel reduction burning has the potential to create unburnt patches in some circumstances, these are likely to exhibit simpler vegetation structure than those arising due to microclimate. Potential refuges in the form of unburnt patches are more likely to arise in landscapes with greater topographic and vegetational variation. Conversely, in more uniform environments, fuel load and/or continuity are likely to have a greater influence on the occurrence of unburnt patches. Understanding these relationships will assist fire managers in directing resources at producing ecological outcomes that are less likely to arise without intervention.},

  abstract = {Understanding temporal variation of threats that cause species endangerment is a key to understand conservation strategies needed to improve species recovery. We assessed temporal variation in the threats to species listed under the United States Endangered Species Act (ESA) as identified by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Based on initial review of ESA listing decisions and literature, we identified six overarching threat categories: habitat modification, overutilization, pollution, species–species interaction, demographic stochasticity, and environmental stochasticity. We screened listing decision documents to determine threat occurrence (i.e., presence/absence of a given threat in a listing decision) for each threat category for all species listed between 1975 and 2017. We evaluated how the number of threats and specific threat occurrences changed over the past four decades. We found that the number of threats per listing decision increased more than twofold from an average of 1.5 (95\% CI: 1.3–1.7) threats in 1975 to 3.7 (95\% CI: 3.4–4.0) threats in 2017. Threat occurrence increased for habitat modification, environmental stochasticity and species–species interaction, while it decreased for overutilization since 1975 and for demographic stochasticity and pollution since the mid-2000s. The documented increase in number of threats at time of listing may be due to a growing human population exerting increased pressure on species persistence, improved scientific advancement in understanding factors influencing species endangerment, or prolonged time taken for more recent species to be listed under the ESA. We believe that key federal and state governmental regulations have resulted in a documented decrease in overutilization, demographic stochasticity, and pollution, and we recommend large-scale strategies combined with local planning efforts to address the growing threats of habitat loss, environmental stochasticity, and species–species interaction.},

  abstract = {Large networks of weather radars are comprehensive instruments for studying bird migration. For example, the US WSR-88D network covers the entire continental US and has archived data since the 1990s. The data can quantify both broad and fine-scale bird movements to address a range of migration ecology questions. However, the problem of automatically discriminating precipitation from biology has significantly limited the ability to conduct biological analyses with historical radar data. We develop MistNet, a deep convolutional neural network to discriminate precipitation from biology in radar scans. Unlike prior machine learning approaches, MistNet makes fine-scaled predictions and can collect biological information from radar scans that also contain precipitation. MistNet is based on neural networks for images, and includes several architecture components tailored to the unique characteristics of radar data. To avoid a massive human labelling effort, we train MistNet using abundant noisy labels obtained from dual polarization radar data. In historical and contemporary WSR-88D data, MistNet identifies at least 95.9\% of all biomass with a false discovery rate of 1.3\%. Dual polarization training data and our radar-specific architecture components are effective. By retaining biomass that co-occurs with precipitation in a single radar scan, MistNet retains 15\% more biomass than traditional whole-scan approaches to screening. MistNet is fully automated and can be applied to datasets of millions of radar scans to produce fine-grained predictions that enable a range of applications, from continent-scale mapping to local analysis of airspace usage. Radar ornithology is advancing rapidly and leading to significant discoveries about continent-scale patterns of bird movements. General-purpose and empirically validated methods to quantify biological signals in radar data are essential to the future development of this field. MistNet can enable large-scale, long-term, and reproducible measurements of whole migration systems.},

  abstract = {Globally, agricultural ecosystems continue to be the most imperiled for biodiversity. Subsequently, countries focused on cost-share conservation programs whereby private landowners are paid to conserve or restore their land. In the United States, populations of grassland and shrubland breeding birds continue to decline, despite state, federal, and private cost-share conservation programs. We related avian occupancy to cost-share conservation programs across the Central Hardwoods Bird Conservation Region using spatially explicit patch-scale survey data. Once per year from 2008 to 2012, we surveyed 5303 discreet points for 9 grassland and shrubland breeding bird species using roadside 5-min point-count surveys in 37 counties across 7 states. We modeled point-specific land cover and heterogeneity in conjunction with cost-share conservation program information using a multi-season robust-design occupancy model. Land-cover covariates were most important in models for species occupancy. For every species except Bell's vireo (Vireo bellii), Field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), and Prairie warbler (Setophaga discolor), addition of conservation covariates to best-supported land-cover models improved occupancy model fit, though effects of conservation programs on occupancy were mixed. Eastern meadowlark occupancy was negatively correlated to the presence of conservation. Alternatively, Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) occupancy was 200\% greater when a conservation practice was at a point rather than being located 4 km away. If cost-share conservation is going to reverse biodiversity declines in agricultural ecosystems, then scale-appropriate models will need to be used to prioritize future implementation because the status quo provides limited mixed effects on grassland and shrubland bird species occupancy.},

To help give these considerations a global perspective, I gathered information concerning instances of negative effects between native (non-introduced) birds worldwide (n = 194) and how managers address these effects. I found reports for 15 species of native birds of concern negatively affected by hybridization, 22 by brood parasitism, 58 by competition, and 99 by predation. Control commonly is used to address brood parasitism by cowbirds (Molothrus spp.), and predation by gulls (Larinae) and corvids (Corvidae), whereas control rarely is used to address competition and is never used to address hybridization. Globally, very few raptors are killed for any of these threats. If the precedent-setting removal study as described here is implemented, it would, during its 1st year, result in the death of 36 times more raptors than in all other conservation-based projects combined in the United States and its territories, and 84 times more raptors than in the largest ongoing effort worldwide. This study could cost \$1 million annually; simplifying the cost to dollars per Barred Owl killed approximates \$700 per Barred Owl for the 1st year and \$2800 per Barred Owl for each subsequent year.},

However, no current U.S. estimates are based on systematic analysis of multiple data sources. We reviewed the published literature and acquired unpublished datasets to systematically quantify bird–building collision mortality and species-specific vulnerability. Based on 23 studies, we estimate that between 365 and 988 million birds (median = 599 million) are killed annually by building collisions in the U.S., with roughly 56\% of mortality at low-rises, 44\% at residences, and {$<$}1\% at high-rises. Based on {$>$}92,000 fatality records, and after controlling for population abundance and range overlap with study sites, we identified several species that are disproportionately vulnerable to collisions at all building types. In addition, several species listed as national Birds of Conservation Concern due to their declining populations were identified to be highly vulnerable to building collisions, including Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera), Painted Bunting (Passerina ciris), Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis), Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), Kentucky Warbler (Geothlypis formosa), and Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorum). The identification of these five migratory species with geographic ranges limited to eastern and central North America reflects seasonal and regional biases in the currently available building-collision data. Most sampling has occurred during migration and in the eastern U.S. Further research across seasons and in underrepresented regions is needed to reduce this bias. Nonetheless, we provide quantitative evidence to support the conclusion that building collisions are second only to feral and free-ranging pet cats, which are estimated to kill roughly four times as many birds each year, as the largest source of direct human-caused mortality for U.S. birds.},

  abstract = {The Saltmarsh Sparrow (Ammospiza caudacuta) is a tidal marsh bird facing rapid population decline throughout its range, largely caused by degradation and loss of breeding habitat. Thus, there is a need to preserve tidal marshes in the northeastern United States, but to do so requires an understanding of the habitat features that support robust populations. Previous studies have shown Saltmarsh Sparrow abundance increases with marsh size, but in similar bird species, area sensitivity is more directly linked to edge avoidance. Whether additional landscape features affect the abundance of Saltmarsh Sparrows is unknown. We explored how the height of objects on the horizon, an index of habitat openness, affected the abundance of Saltmarsh Sparrows. Our primary goal was to determine whether the angle to the highest point on the horizon ("angle to maximum horizon") predicted abundance better than marsh area or distance to the marsh edge. We used N-mixture models to evaluate the combination of spatial factors that best predicted Saltmarsh Sparrow abundance while also accounting for survey-level variables that could influence detection probability. We found that the interaction between distance to edge and angle to maximum horizon best predicted abundance. Taller objects on the horizon were negatively correlated with bird abundance, and this effect was strongest within 50 m of the marsh edge. When we considered the predictive powers of patch area, distance to edge, and angle to maximum horizon individually, angle to maximum horizon was the best single predictor. We found the highest abundance of Saltmarsh Sparrows at point locations where the angle to maximum horizon was 0.0°, and at angles greater than 12° the predicted abundance fell below 1 bird per survey point. We propose that managers should prioritize marsh openness and experimentally test the effect of marsh edge manipulations when making conservation decisions for this rapidly declining species.},

  abstract = {BackgroundMigratory animals comprise a significant portion of biodiversity worldwide with annual investment for their conservation exceeding several billion dollars. Designing effective conservation plans presents enormous challenges. Migratory species are influenced by multiple events across land and sea–regions that are often separated by thousands of kilometres and span international borders. To date, conservation strategies for migratory species fail to take into account how migratory animals are spatially connected between different periods of the annual cycle (i.e. migratory connectivity) bringing into question the utility and efficiency of current conservation efforts.Methodology/Principal FindingsHere, we report the first framework for determining an optimal conservation strategy for a migratory species. Employing a decision theoretic approach using dynamic optimization, we address the problem of how to allocate resources for habitat conservation for a Neotropical-Nearctic migratory bird, the American redstart Setophaga ruticilla, whose winter habitat is under threat. Our first conservation strategy used the acquisition of winter habitat based on land cost, relative bird density, and the rate of habitat loss to maximize the abundance of birds on the wintering grounds. Our second strategy maximized bird abundance across the entire range of the species by adding the constraint of maintaining a minimum percentage of birds within each breeding region in North America using information on migratory connectivity as estimated from stable-hydrogen isotopes in feathers. We show that failure to take into account migratory connectivity may doom some regional populations to extinction, whereas including information on migratory connectivity results in the protection of the species across its entire range.Conclusions/SignificanceWe demonstrate that conservation strategies for migratory animals depend critically upon two factors: knowledge of migratory connectivity and the correct statement of the conservation problem. Our framework can be used to identify efficient conservation strategies for migratory taxa worldwide, including insects, birds, mammals, and marine organisms.},

This assumption of static occupancy is especially true in studies of birds, even though many bird species are known to abandon failed nest sites in search of better habitat or to move up a habitat gradient as the season proceeds. If birds move into different habitats as the season progresses, studies assuming static use of habitat may provide misleading or incomplete inference into habitat use. We tested the hypothesis that birds use different habitats as the breeding season progresses by analyzing point counts conducted early and late in the breeding season within Tuskegee National Forest, AL. For 15 species of conservation concern, we compared models that assumed static occupancy with models that estimated apparent movement between early and late-season surveys. Models that estimated movement outcompeted static models for every species. Furthermore, patterns of movement provided inference that would not have been gained through a static modeling approach, with species moving into habitats traditionally known to be of high quality, and moving out of those assumed to be of poor quality. Our results suggest that studies of habitat use would benefit from estimating movement within a season.},

Widespread declines of farmland birds are also occurring in Great Britain and western Europe, largely due to the intensification of agricultural operations. Habitat loss has been the major driving force for declines of grassland birds up until the last 50 years when the intensification of mechanized agricultural operations, along with increased habitat fragmentation that is associated with larger “industrial” farm sizes, became strong factors. Other threats to grassland birds come from invasive species and planting of exotic grasses, urbanization, residential development, oil and gas extraction, wind power development, excessive predation/parasitism, fire suppression that results in succession to shrubland, ground water depletion, development of transportation corridors, use of pesticides, and rodent eradication programs. No single management approach or conservation solution will benefit the entire suite of grassland bird species across large geographic regions. Just stabilizing populations of grassland birds at their present levels presents a huge conservation challenge. © 2005 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

Phenological responses to climate linking these stages may ultimately impact fitness. We analyzed five decades of banding data from 17 migratory bird species to investigate 1) how spring arrival related to timing of breeding, 2) if the interval between arrival and breeding has changed with increasing spring temperatures, and 3) whether arrival timing or breeding timing best predicted local productivity. Four of 17 species, all mid- to long-distance migrants, hatched young earlier in years when migrants arrived earlier to the breeding grounds (\{\textbackslash textasciitilde\}1:1 day advancement). The interval between arrival on breeding grounds and appearance of juveniles shortened with warmer spring temperatures for 12 species (1–6 days for every 1°C increase) and over time for seven species (1–8 days per decade), suggesting that some migratory passerines adapt to climate change by laying more quickly after arrival or reducing the time from laying to fledging. We found more support for the former, that the rate of reproductive advancement was higher than that for arrival in warm years. Timing of spring arrival and breeding were both poor predictors of avian productivity for most migrants analyzed. Nevertheless, we found evidence that fitness benefits may occur from shifts to earlier spring arrival for the multi-brooded Song Sparrow. Our results uniquely demonstrate that co-occurring avian species are phenologically plastic in their response to climate change on their breeding grounds. If migrants continue to show a weaker response to temperatures during migration than breeding, and the window between arrival and optimal breeding shortens further, biological constraints to plasticity may limit the ability of species to adapt successfully to future warming.},

We measured a controlled effect of predation risk along a 3350-kilometer south-north gradient in the Arctic and found that nest predation risk declined more than twofold along the latitudinal gradient.

Field sparrow (Spizella pusilla) territory density was ≥3 times greater in wildlife fields than in all other field types. Indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea) territory density was 5.6 and 14.6 times greater in wildlife fields than in grazed and hayed, non-native cool-season fields, respectively. Reproductive effort for grassland and shrubland birds did not differ among field types. Our data suggest dense stands of tall, native warm-season grass are not a better alternative to non-native cool-season grass pastures for grassland songbirds, especially eastern meadowlark.

However, landowners have been slow to adopt appropriate practices in the US Midwest. The purpose of this study was to explore attitudes and behaviors of private landowners toward prescribed burning and moderate stocking as rangeland management tools. A survey was mailed to 193 landowners (response rate 51\%) in the Grand River Grasslands region of southern Iowa and northern Missouri. While 68\% of landowners viewed grazing as a legitimate land management tool, only half of landowners thought of fire as a legitimate tool. Over 75\% of respondents believed that the increase in eastern redcedar and other trees in grasslands was a problem, with 44\% considering it a major problem. Although 84\% of landowners said that they had taken action to control eastern redcedar, only 25\% had participated in a prescribed burn. Income from agriculture and recreational goals were negatively and significantly correlated (-0.252, P{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}0.035). While holding recreational goals constant in the analysis, landowners reporting income from agriculture goals as very or extremely important were negatively and significantly associated with reporting environment and grassland factors as very or extremely important. Adoption of prescribed burning by private landowners might be more widespread if proponents focus on the effectiveness of fire for controlling eastern redcedar, which is viewed as a problem by most landowners in the region. Intervention efforts must include landowners with different goals as part of the promotion and educational process. Resumen La restauración exitosa de praderas depende en parte de poder convencer a propietarios de tierras privadas utilizadas con fines agrícolas o de recreación, que implementen prácticas de manejo apropiadas tales como quemas controladas y pastoreo bovino para controlar especies invasoras y la expansión de plantas leñosas. Sin embargo, los propietarios de tierras en la región del Medio-Oeste de los EE.UU. han demostrado lentitud en la adopción de prácticas apropiadas. El propósito de este estudio fue explorar las actitudes y conductas de propietarios de tierras privadas hacia el uso de quemas controladas y pastoreo moderado como herramientas de manejo. Se envió una encuesta por correo a 193 propietarios de tierras (la tasa de respuesta fue del 51\%) en la región de Grand River Grasslands del sur de Iowa y norte de Missouri. Mientras que 68\% de los propietarios de tierras opinaron que el pastoreo es una herramienta de manejo legítima, solamente la mitad de los propietarios de tierras consideraron el uso del fuego como una herramienta legítima. Más del 75\% de los encuestados manifestaron creer que el aumento de Juniperus virginiana y otros árboles en los pastizales es un problema, y 44\% consideró que este es un problema mayor. Si bien el 84\% de los propietarios de tierras manifestaron haber tomado acción para controlar J. virginiana, sólo el 25\% había participado en una quema prescripta. Los ingresos obtenidos por actividades agrícolas y de recreación exhibieron una correlación negativa significativa (-0.252, P{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}0.035). Manteniendo las metas de recreación constantes en el análisis, los propietarios de tierras que consideraron sus ingresos agrícolas como muy importantes o extremadamente importantes estuvieron asociados negativa y significativamente con apreciaciones de factores del ambiente y los pastizales como muy importantes o extremadamente importantes. La adopción de quemas controladas por parte de los propietarios de tierras privadas podría ser más generalizada si sus proponentes se enfocaran en el uso del fuego para controlar J. virginiana que es considerada como un problema por la mayoría de los propietarios de tierras de la región. Los esfuerzos de intervención deben incluir propietarios de tierras con diferentes metas como parte del proceso de educación y promoción.},

Migratory birds, as long-distance travelers of the globe, depend on rapid access to accurate information and thus provide particularly interesting study subjects for cognitive ecology. Yet, questions regarding how migratory birds collect information and make decisions en route remain to be answered. Here, we review the current status of this field of study and focus our attention on social learning (broadly defined as the use of inadvertently produced social information) as an important cognitive mechanism that can operate across taxonomic boundaries. We argue that social learning is critical to accelerate resource acquisition while reducing risks and uncertainties during migration. We put forward eight testable predictions in relation to when increased use of social information might be expected.

  abstract = {Global population growth and associated urban development are having profound effects on biodiversity. Two major outcomes of expanding development that affect wildlife are light and noise pollution. In this paper, we review literature reporting the effects of light and noise on biodiversity, and assess implications for conservation planning in Australia. Our results clearly indicate that light and noise pollution have the potential to affect the physiology, behaviour and reproduction of a range of animal taxa. Types of effects include changes in foraging and reproductive behaviours, reduction in animal fitness, increased risk of predation and reduced reproductive success. These could have flow-on consequences at the population and ecosystem levels. We found a significant gap in knowledge of the impact of these pollutants on Australian fauna. To reduce the effect of light and noise pollution, there needs to be careful planning of urban areas in relation to protected areas, and for biodiversity more generally. Potential measures include strategically planning the types of development and associated human activities adjacent to protected areas, and the use of shields and barriers, such as covers for lights or the use of dense native vegetation screens, while still allowing movement of animals. Changes in government standards and regulations could also help to reduce the impacts of light and noise pollution.},

  abstract = {Fire influences the distribution of fauna in terrestrial biomes throughout the world. Use of fire to achieve a mosaic of vegetation in different stages of succession after burning (i.e., patch-mosaic burning) is a dominant conservation practice in many regions. Despite this, knowledge of how the spatial attributes of vegetation mosaics created by fire affect fauna is extremely scarce, and it is unclear what kind of mosaic land managers should aim to achieve. We selected 28 landscapes (each 12.6 km2) that varied in the spatial extent and diversity of vegetation succession after fire in a 104,000 km2 area in the semiarid region of southeastern Australia. We surveyed for reptiles at 280 sites nested within the 28 landscapes. The landscape-level occurrence of 9 of the 22 species modeled was associated with the spatial extent of vegetation age classes created by fire. Biogeographic context and the extent of a vegetation type influenced 7 and 4 species, respectively. No species were associated with the diversity of vegetation ages within a landscape. Negative relations between reptile occurrence and both extent of recently burned vegetation (≤10 years postfire, n = 6) and long unburned vegetation ({$>$}35 years postfire, n = 4) suggested that a coarse-grained mosaic of areas (e.g. {$>$}1000 ha) of midsuccessional vegetation (11–35 years postfire) may support the fire-sensitive reptile species we modeled. This age class coincides with a peak in spinifex cover, a keystone structure for reptiles in semiarid and arid Australia. Maintaining over the long term a coarse-grained mosaic of large areas of midsuccessional vegetation in mallee ecosystems will need to be balanced against the short-term negative effects of large fires on many reptile species and a documented preference by species from other taxonomic groups, particularly birds, for older vegetation. Mosaicos de Fuego y la Conservación de Reptiles en una Región Propensa al Fuego El fuego influye en la distribución de la fauna en biomas terrestres en todo el mundo. El uso de fuego para obtener un mosaico de vegetación en diferentes etapas sucesionales después de la quema (i.e., quema de mosaico de parches) es una práctica de conservación dominante en muchas regiones. No obstante lo anterior, el conocimiento de la forma en que los mosaicos de vegetación creados por fuego afectan a la fauna es muy escaso, y no es claro el tipo de mosaico que deben tener en cuenta los manejadores de tierras. Seleccionamos 28 paisajes (12.6 km2 cada uno) que variaron en extensión y diversidad de sucesión vegetal después de fuego en una región semiárida de 104,000 km2 en el sureste de Australia. Muestreamos reptiles en 280 sitios ubicados en los 28 paisajes. La ocurrencia a nivel paisaje de 9 de las 22 especies modeladas se asoció con la extensión espacial de las clases de edad de la vegetación creadas por el fuego. El contexto biogeográfico y la extensión del tipo de vegetación influyeron en 7 y 4 especies, respectivamente. Ninguna especie se asoció con la diversidad de edades de la vegetación en el paisaje. Las relaciones negativas entre la ocurrencia de reptiles y la extensión de vegetación quemada recientemente (≤10 años postfuego, n = 6) y de vegetación no quemada por largo tiempo ({$<$}35 años postfuego, n = 4) sugieren que un mosaico de grano grueso de áreas (e.g., {$>$}1,000 ha) con vegetación en etapa sucesional media (11-35 años postfuego) puede soportar a las especies de reptiles sensibles al fuego que modelamos. Esta clase de edad coincide con un pico en la cobertura de spinifex, una estructura clave para reptiles en ambientes semiáridos y áridos de Australia. El mantenimiento a largo plazo del mosaico de grano grueso de áreas con vegetación en etapa sucesional media en ecosistemas de mallee tendrá que balancearse con los efectos negativos a corto plazo de incendios extensivos sobre muchas especies de reptiles y la preferencia documentada de otros grupos taxonómicos, particularmente aves, por vegetación más madura.},

The 2016 release saw landcover created for additional years of 2003, 2008, and 2013. These products provide spatially explicit and reliable information on the Nation?s land cover and land cover change. To continue the legacy of NLCD and further establish a long-term monitoring capability for the Nation?s land resources, the USGS has designed a new generation of NLCD products named NLCD 2019. The NLCD 2019 design aims to provide innovative, consistent, and robust methodologies for production of a multi-temporal land cover and land cover change database from 2001 to 2019 at 2-3-year intervals. Comprehensive research was conducted and resulted in developed strategies for NLCD 2019: continued integration between impervious surface and all landcover products with impervious surface being directly mapped as developed classes in the landcover, a streamlined compositing process for assembling and preprocessing based on Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a multi-source integrated training data development and decision-tree based land cover classifications; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover change analysis strategy; a hierarchical theme-based post-classification and integration protocol for generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling method; and an automated scripted operational system for the NLCD 2019 production. The performance of the developed strategies and methods were tested in twenty composite referenced areas throughout the conterminous U.S. An overall accuracy assessment from the 2016 publication give a 91\% overall landcover accuracy, with the developed classes also showing a 91percent accuracy in overall developed. Results from this study confirm the robustness of this comprehensive and highly automated procedure for NLCD 2019 operational mapping. Questions about the NLCD 2019 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2019 land cover mapping team at USGS EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.

  abstract = {Abstract: Feral cats are directly responsible for a large percentage of global extinctions, particularly on islands. We reviewed feral cat eradication programs with the intent of providing information for future island conservation actions. Most insular cat introductions date from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, whereas successful eradication programs have been carried out in the last 30 years, most in the last decade. Globally, feral cats have been removed from at least 48 islands: 16 in Baja California (Mexico), 10 in New Zealand, 5 in Australia, 4 in the Pacific Ocean, 4 in Seychelles, 3 in the sub-Antarctic, 3 in Macaronesia (Atlantic Ocean), 2 in Mauritius, and 1 in the Caribbean. The majority of these islands (75\%; n= 36) are small (≤5 km2). The largest successful eradication campaign took place on Marion Island (290 km2), but cats have been successfully removed from only 10 islands (21\%) of ≥10 km2. On Cousine Island (Seychelles) cat density reached 243 cats/km2, but on most islands densities did not exceed 79.2 cats/km2 (n= 22; 81\%). The most common methods in successful eradication programs were trapping and hunting (often with dogs; 91\% from a total of 43 islands). Frequently, these methods were used together. Other methods included poisoning (1080; monofluoracetate in fish baits; n= 13; 31\%), secondary poisoning from poisoned rats (n= 4; 10\%), and introduction of viral disease (feline panleucopaenia; n= 2; 5\%). Impacts from cat predation and, more recently, the benefits of cat eradications have been increasingly documented. These impacts and benefits, combined with the continued success of eradication campaigns on larger islands, show the value and role of feral cat eradications in biodiversity conservation. However, new and more efficient techniques used in combination with current techniques will likely be needed for success on larger islands.},

  abstract = {Identifying the factors that control population dynamics in migratory animals has been constrained by our inability to track individuals throughout the annual cycle. Using stable carbon isotopes, we show that the reproductive success of a long-distance migratory bird is influenced by the quality of habitat located thousands of kilometres away on tropical wintering grounds. For male American redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla), winter habitat quality influenced arrival date on the breeding grounds, which in turn affected key variables associated with reproduction, including the number of young fledged. Based on a winter-habitat model, females occupying high-quality winter habitat were predicted to produce more than two additional young and to fledge offspring up to a month earlier compared with females wintering in poor-quality habitat. Differences of this magnitude are highly important considering redstarts are single brooded, lay clutches of only three to five eggs and spend only two-and-a-half months on the breeding grounds. Results from this study indicate the importance of understanding how periods of the annual cycle interact for migratory animals. Continued loss of tropical wintering habitat could have negative effects on migratory populations in the following breeding season, minimizing density-dependent effects on the breeding grounds and leading to further population declines. If conservation efforts are to be successful, strategies must incorporate measures to protect all the habitats used during the entire annual cycle of migratory animals.},

The bird community index (BCI) sorts bird species found at sample sites into a series of values representing the proportional species richness of 20 behavioral and physiological response guilds. Relative proportions of specialist and generalist guilds are used to assign a composite score to each site. Scores from multiple sites indicate the overall biotic integrity of the study area. The BCI is intended to function as a landscape-scale indicator of biotic integrity, integrating conditions across large sample sites containing diverse ecological resources and intensities of human use. We developed the BCI with data from a 1994 pilot study in central Pennsylvania, then applied our preliminary index in 1995 and 1996 to independent samples of sites across the Mid-Atlantic Highlands Assessment area (MAHA). The 1995 and 1996 sample sites were selected using the probability-based sampling design of the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP), and therefore represent the total land area in MAHA. Our preliminary assessment indicates that MAHA exhibits six categories of biotic integrity, and that more than 40\% of the land area supports the two highest biotic integrity categories. Pending BCI refinement and incorporation of landscape and vegetation explanatory variables, the BCI will be included in a suite of indicators designed to provide an assessment of overall ecological condition in MAHA.},

However, changes occurring during the Anthropocene continue to threaten biodiversity and, therefore, the associated ecosystem services that maintain human well-being. Despite efforts to integrate protected areas into a wider landscape, most of these areas are still managed as islands within a matrix of degraded territory; there is no clear conceptual framework that integrates them into the surrounding landscape. We first review the evolution of the protected-area concept. Then, we acknowledge the main limitations that protected areas face for long-term conservation. Next, we discuss how the ecosystem service approach could overcome some of these protected-area limitations. Finally, we propose a social-ecological approach for protected areas to maintain high biodiversity and its associated flow of ecosystem services in the context of uncertainty. © 2014 The Author(s) 2014.

Differences in pollinator communities throughout the plants’ range will have implications for the ecology and evolution of a plant species, including that differences may affect the male fitness of individual plants or the reproductive success of plant populations, or both.},

Spatial and temporal heterogeneity is thought to be a major source of biotic diversity, and disturbances such as fire, producing heterogeneity are now recognised as being important. A patch-mosaic system of burning is based on the premise that fire pattern is a surrogate for diversity, and produces a range of patches in the landscape with unique patch characteristics and fire histories. A patch-mosaic system of burning is supported historically and empirically through field studies. However, there is a need for more research into the effects of various aspects of patch and fire variables on biotic diversity, especially in savannas where our understanding is particularly poor. Landscape-scale experiments, like those to be established in the Kruger National Park, South Africa are necessary to test different burning regimes. Challenges to patch- mosaic burning include determining the 'natural' range of variation for fire parameters, implementing random ignitions, and cost-effective fire scar mapping at the appropriate resolution. An adaptive management approach should be adopted to deal with the ignorance and uncertainties that characterise the management of savanna ecosystems. This should be applied with both modelling and monitoring as key elements in this process.},

It has been widely accepted that temperature is the principal control on the distribution of C3 and C4 species. Our results show that precipitation and its seasonal distribution are also important. C4 grass distribution was positively related to three climatic variables: mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, and the proportion of the precipitation falling in summer. These variables accounted for 66\% of the total variability of this functional type. C3 grass abundance decreased with mean annual temperature and increased with the proportion of the precipitation falling during winter (r2 = 0.37). Sixty-two percent of the variability in the relative abundance of shrubs was explained by mean annual precipitation and the proportion of winter precipitation. Latitude and longitude explained a substantial portion of the variability of the distribution of the relative abundance of shrubs, C3 grasses, and C4 grasses (53, 46, and 61\%, respectively). Along a given longitude, C3 grasses increased with latitude. As one moves westward, C4 grasses are replaced by shrubs. The relative abundance of C4 grasses reached a maximum at southern latitudes and eastern longitudes. Succulents showed a marginal decreasing trend with latitude. No relationship with geographic variables was detected for forbs.},

However, previous studies of C3 and C4 grass biogeography have often inadvertently compared species in different and relatively unrelated lineages, which are associated with different environmental settings and distinct adaptive traits. Such confounded comparisons of C3 and C4 grasses may bias our understanding of ecological sorting imposed strictly by photosynthetic pathway. Here, we used MaxEnt species distribution modeling in combination with satellite data to understand the functional diversity of C3 and C4 grasses by comparing both large clades and closely related sister taxa. Similar to previous work, we found that C4 grasses showed a preference for regions with higher temperatures and lower precipitation compared with grasses using the C3 pathway. However, air temperature differences were smaller (2 °C vs. 4 °C) and precipitation and \% tree cover differences were larger (1783 mm vs. 755 mm, 21.3\% vs. 7.7\%, respectively) when comparing C3 and C4 grasses within the same clade vs. comparing all C4 and all C3 grasses (i.e., ignoring phylogenetic structure). These results were due to important differences in the environmental preferences of C3 BEP and PACMAD clades (the two main grass clades). Winter precipitation was found to be more important for understanding the distribution and environmental niche of C3 PACMADs in comparison with both C3 BEPs and C4 taxa, for which temperature was much more important. Results comparing closely related C3–C4 sister taxa supported the patterns derived from our modeling of the larger clade groupings. Our findings, which are novel in comparing the distribution and niches of clades, demonstrate that the evolutionary history of taxa is important for understanding the functional diversity of C3 and C4 grasses, and should have implications for how grasslands will respond to global change.},

  abstract = {The decline of biodiversity from anthropogenic landscape modification is among the most pressing conservation problems worldwide. In North America, long-term population declines have elevated the recovery of the grassland avifauna to among the highest conservationpriorities. Because the vast majority of grasslands of the Great Plains are privately owned, the recovery of these ecosystems and bird populations within them depend on landscape-scale conservation strategies that integrate social, economic, and biodiversity objectives. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a voluntary program for private agricultural producers administered by the United States Department of Agriculture that provides financial incentives to take cropland out of production and restore perennial grassland. We investigated spatial patterns of grassland availability and restoration to inform landscape-scale conservation for a comprehensive community of grassland birds in the Great Plains. The research objectives were to (1) determine how apparent habitat loss has affected spatial patterns of grassland bird biodiversity, (2) evaluate the effectiveness of CRP for offsetting the biodiversity declines of grassland birds, and (3) develop spatially explicit predictions to estimate the biodiversity benefit of adding CRP to landscapes impacted by habitat loss. We used the Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions program to evaluate hypotheses for the effects of habitat loss and restoration on both the occupancy and species richness of grassland specialists within a continuum-modeling framework. We found the odds of community occupancy declined by 37\% for every 1 SD decrease in grassland availability [loge(km2)] and increased by 20\% for every 1 SD increase in CRP land cover [loge(km2)]. There was 17\% turnover in species composition between intact grasslands and CRP landscapes, suggesting that grasslands restored by CRP retained considerable, but incomplete, representation of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Spatially explicit predictions indicated that absolute conservation outcomes were greatest at high latitudes in regions with high biodiversity, whereas the relative outcomes were greater at low latitudes in highly modified landscapes. By evaluating community-wide responses to landscape modification and CRP restoration at bioregional scales, our study fills key information gaps for developing collaborative strategies, and for balancing conservation of avian biodiversity and social well-being in the agricultural production landscapes of the Great Plains.},

  abstract = {Projections of future climate change are increasingly based on the output of many different models. Typically, the mean over all model simulations is considered as the optimal prediction, with the underlying assumption that different models provide statistically independent information evenly distributed around the true state. However, there is reason to believe that this is not the best assumption. Coupled models are of comparable complexity and are constructed in similar ways. Some models share parts of the same code and some models are even developed at the same center. Therefore, the limitations of these models tend to be fairly similar, contributing to the well-known problem of common model biases and possibly to an unreal-istically small spread in the outcomes of model predictions. This study attempts to quantify the extent of this problem by asking how many models there effectively are and how to best determine this number. Quantifying the effective number of models is achieved by evaluating 24 state-of-the-art models and their ability to simulate broad aspects of twentieth-century climate. Using two different approaches, the amount of unique information in the ensemble is calculated and the effective en-semble size is found to be much smaller than the actual number of models. As more models are included in an ensemble, the amount of new information diminishes in proportion. Furthermore, this reduction is found to go beyond the problem of ''same center'' models and systemic similarities are seen to exist across all models. The results suggest that current methodologies for the interpretation of multimodel ensembles may lead to overly confident climate predictions.},

From 2002 to 2005, in the Champlain Valley of Vermont and New York, USA, we studied the reproductive success of Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) and Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) on four grassland treatments: (1) early-hayed fields cut before 11 June and again in early- to mid-July; (2) middle-hayed fields cut once between 21 June and 10 July; (3) late-hayed fields cut after 1 August; and (4) rotationally grazed pastures. Both the number of fledglings per female per year and nest success (logistic-exposure method) varied among treatments and between species. Although birds initiated nests earlier on early-hayed fields compared to others, haying caused 99\% of active Savannah Sparrow and 100\% of active Bobolink nests to fail. Both the initial cutting date and time between cuttings influenced renesting behavior. After haying, Savannah Sparrows generally remained on early-hayed fields and immediately renested (clutch completion 15.6 ± 1.28 days post-haying; all values are reported as mean ± se), while Bobolinks abandoned the fields for at least two weeks (mean clutch completion 33 ± 0.82 days post-haying). While female Savannah Sparrows fledged more offspring per year (1.28 ± 0.16) than female Bobolinks (0.05 ± 0.05), reproductive success on early-hayed fields was low. The number of fledglings per female per year was greater on middle-hayed fields (Savannah Sparrows, 3.47 ± 0.42; Bobolinks, 2.22 ± 0.26), and late-hayed fields (Savannah Sparrows, 3.29 ± 0.30; Bobolinks, 2.79 ± 0.18). Reproductive success was moderate on rotationally grazed pastures, where female Savannah Sparrows and female Bobolinks produced 2.32 ± 0.25 and 1.79 ± 0.33 fledgling per year, respectively. We simultaneously conducted cutting surveys throughout the Champlain Valley and found that 3–8\% of hayfield habitat was cut by 1–4 June, 25–40\% by 12–16 June, and 32–60\% by 28 June–2 July. Thus, the majority of grassland habitat was cut during the breeding season; however, late-hayed fields served as high-quality reserves for late-nesting female Bobolinks that were displaced from previously hayed fields. For fields first cut in May, a 65-day interval between cuts could provide enough time for both species to successfully fledge young.},

Few studies calibrate extinction with habitat reduction. Critics raise doubts about this calibration, noting that there has been extensive clearing of the eastern North American forest, yet only 4 of its approximately 200 bird species have gone extinct. We analyze the distribution of bird species and the timing and extent of forest loss. The forest losses were not concurrent across the region. Based on the maximum extent of forest losses, our calculations predict fewer extinctions than the number observed. At most, there are 28 species of birds restricted to the region. Only these species would be at risk even if all the forests were cleared. Far from providing comfort to those who argue that the current rapid rate of tropical deforestation might cause fewer extinctions than often claimed, our results suggest that the losses may be worse. In contrast to eastern North America, small regions of tropical forest often hold hundreds of endemic bird species.},

Although this ecological light pollution is damaging ecosystems throughout the world, the topic has received relatively little attention. Many nocturnally migrating birds die or lose a large amount of their energy reserves during migration as a result of encountering artificial light sources. This happens, for instance, in the North Sea, where large numbers of nocturnally migrating birds are attracted to the many offshore platforms. Our aim is to develop bird-friendly artificial lighting that meets human demands for safety but does not attract and disorient birds. Our current working hypothesis is that artificial light interferes with the magnetic compass of the birds, one of several orientation mechanisms and especially important during overcast nights. Laboratory experiments have shown the magnetic compass to be wavelength dependent: migratory birds require light from the blue-green part of the spectrum for magnetic compass orientation, whereas red light (visible long-wavelength) disrupts magnetic orientation. We designed a field study to test if and how changing light color influenced migrating birds under field conditions. We found that nocturnally migrating birds were disoriented and attracted by red and white light (containing visible long-wavelength radiation), whereas they were clearly less disoriented by blue and green light (containing less or no visible long-wavelength radiation). This was especially the case on overcast nights. Our results clearly open perspective for the development of bird-friendly artificial lighting by manipulating wavelength characteristics. Preliminary results with an experimentally developed bird-friendly light source on an offshore platform are promising. What needs to be investigated is the impact of bird-friendly light on other organisms than birds.},

  abstract = {Grassland birds have declined more than any other avian assemblage in North America, with nearly every species showing negative population trends. In the Flint Hills of Kansas, the largest remnant of the tallgrass prairie biome, annual spring burning of rangeland has recently replaced burning every 23 years. I examined effects of different burning and bison (Bos bison) grazing regimes on June abundances of seven bird species using a 23-year data set from the Konza Prairie Biological Station. Fire significantly affected the abundances of six of the seven species. Effects varied among species but, notably, four grass-dependent speciesGrasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), Henslows Sparrow (A. henslowii), Dickcissel (Spiza americana), and Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna) and the shrub-dependent Bells Vireo (Vireo bellii)were least abundant or absent at sites in the breeding season immediately following burning. Upland Sandpipers (Bartramia longicauda) were most abundant at sites in the season following burning, whereas Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) exhibited no significant response. Bison grazing increased abundance of Upland Sandpiper and Grasshopper Sparrow, nearly eliminated Henslows Sparrow, and (in combination with recent fire) lowered the abundance of Dickcissel. Although fire and grazing are natural forces that maintain tallgrass prairie, their action was, until recently, intermittent and patchy, providing grassland birds with a variety of levels of disturbance. If the vast Flint Hills prairie is to serve as a grassland bird stronghold, the region-wide practice of annual burning with intensive grazing must be replaced with alternatives that restore heterogeneity to the landscape.},

This has been causing rapid environmental shifts that have altered the selective regimes determining the annual organization of birds. In order to assess the potential for adaptive evolution in the timing of autumn migration, we estimated heritabilities of the onset of migratory activity in a southern German blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla) population. Heritabilities (h2=0.34-0.45) and coefficients of additive genetic variation (CV(A)=4.7-5.7) were significant and consistent when estimated by different methods, irrespective of whether they were derived from birds hatched in the wild or bred in captivity. In an artificial selection experiment, we selected for later onset of migratory activity, simulating expected natural selection on this trait. We obtained a significant delay in the mean onset of migratory activity by more than one week after two generations of selection. Realized heritability (h2=0.55) was in agreement with expected heritability in the cohort that the selection line was derived from. Our results suggest that evolutionary changes in the timing of autumn migration may take place over a very short time period and will most probably be unconstrained by the lack of additive genetic variation.},

These characteristics can be measured for and tested experimentally on a species-by-species basis.

On Ascension Island the introduction of cats in 1815 resulted in extirpation of large seabird colonies from the main island, with relict populations of most species persisting only in cat-inaccessible locations. We describe the eradication of feral cats from this large and populated island. The campaign had to minimize risk to humans and maintain domestic animals in a state that prevented them re-establishing a feral population. Feral cat numbers declined rapidly in response to the strategic deployment of poisoning and live trapping, and cats were eradicated from the island within 2 years. During the project 38\% of domestic cats were killed accidentally, which caused public consternation; we make recommendations for reducing such problems in future eradications. Since the completion of the eradication campaign cat predation of adult seabirds has ceased and five seabird species have recolonized the mainland in small but increasing numbers. Breeding success of seabirds at Ascension was low compared to that of conspecifics elsewhere, and the roles of food availability, inexperience of parent birds and black rat predation in causing this warrant further investigation. It is likely that the low breeding success will result in the rate of increase in seabird populations being slow.},

While studies of effectiveness have improved our understanding of protected-area design and management, few investigations ({$<$} 5\%) have quantified the ecological performance of reserves for conserving species. Here, we present an empirical evaluation of protected-area effectiveness using long-term measures of a vulnerable assemblage of species. We compare forest and woodland bird diversity in the Australian Capital Territory over 11 yr on protected and unprotected areas located in temperate eucalypt woodland and matched by key habitat attributes. We examine separately the response of birds to protected areas established prior to 1995 and after 1995 when fundamental changes were made to regional conservation policy. Bird diversity was measured in richness, occurrence of vulnerable species, individual species trajectories and functional trait groups. We found that protected areas were effective in maintaining woody vegetation cover in the study region, but were less effective in the protection of the target bird species assemblage. Protected areas were less species rich than unprotected areas, with significant declines in richness across sites protected prior to 1995. Small, specialised and vulnerable species showed stronger associations with unprotected areas than protected areas. Our findings indicate that recently established reserves (post-1995) are performing similarly to unprotected woodland areas in terms of maintaining woodland bird diversity, and that both of these areas are more effective in the conservation of woodland bird populations than reserves established prior to 1995. We demonstrate that the conservation value of protected areas is strongly influenced by the physical characteristics, as well as the landscape context, of a given reserve and can diminish with changes in surrounding land use over time. Both protected areas and off-reserve conservation schemes have important roles to play in securing species populations.},

  abstract = {Because of the declines in grassland bird populations across North America, many state and federal agencies are making efforts to manage for grassland bird populations, particularly in a landscape context. To effectively manage for grassland birds, we need to understand how grassland bird species use different habitat types within landscapes. We determined the densities of grassland birds in remnant prairie patches and Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) fields and compared those to managed agricultural habitat types (pastures, alfalfa hay and strip crop fields). We also investigated whether densities were associated with landscape features. This study took place in the Military Ridge Prairie Heritage Area (MRPHA) in southwestern Wisconsin May–Jul. 2002 and 2003. Land use in the MRPHA is primarily agricultural, with a relatively large portion of the land in pasture, hay, small grains and idle grasslands enrolled in CRP and relatively few acres of corn and soybeans compared to other areas of the state. This area also has numerous remnant prairie patches. We used line transect surveys to measure species density in the different habitat types. The five most common grassland species in the study area were bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna), grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), Henslow's sparrow (A. henslowii) and Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis). Densities did not differ between years. Habitat type was the most important factor associated with species density. Bobolink densities were greatest in hay fields, followed by CRP fields. Eastern meadowlark densities were greatest in CRP fields, remnant prairie patches and pastures. Grasshopper sparrow densities were greatest in remnant prairie, Henslow's sparrow densities were greatest in CRP fields and remnant prairie and Savannah sparrow densities were greatest in pasture and hay fields. There was no evidence that densities of any of the grassland species increased with site size within habitat type. Only bobolink and eastern meadowlark were associated with a landscape variable; both species' densities in the field were positively associated with proportion of grassland within 200 m of the site. When managing for grassland birds in a landscape with a large amount of grassland, a diversity of habitat types will be needed to conserve grassland birds as a group.},

  abstract = {Background Quantifying changes in forest bird diversity is an essential task for developing effective conservation actions. When subtle changes in diversity accumulate over time, annual comparisons may offer an incomplete perspective of changes in diversity. In this case, progressive change, the comparison of changes in diversity from a baseline condition, may offer greater insight because changes in diversity are assessed over longer periods of times. Our objectives were to determine how forest bird diversity has changed over time and whether those changes were associated with forest disturbance.  Methodology/Principal Findings We used North American Breeding Bird Survey data, a time series of Landsat images classified with respect to land cover change, and mixed-effects models to associate changes in forest bird community structure with forest disturbance, latitude, and longitude in the conterminous United States for the years 1985 to 2006. We document a significant divergence from the baseline structure for all birds of similar migratory habit and nest location, and all forest birds as a group from 1985 to 2006. Unexpectedly, decreases in progressive similarity resulted from small changes in richness ({$<$}1 species per route for the 22-year study period) and modest losses in abundance (−28.7–−10.2 individuals per route) that varied by migratory habit and nest location. Forest disturbance increased progressive similarity for Neotropical migrants, permanent residents, ground nesting, and cavity nesting species. We also documented highest progressive similarity in the eastern United States.  Conclusions/Significance Contemporary forest bird community structure is changing rapidly over a relatively short period of time (e.g., ∼22 years). Forest disturbance and forest regeneration are primary factors associated with contemporary forest bird community structure, longitude and latitude are secondary factors, and forest loss is a tertiary factor. Importantly, these findings suggest some regions of the United States may already fall below the habitat amount threshold where fragmentation effects become important predictors of forest bird community structure.},

Yet, understanding the spatially extensive effects of land-cover change has been challenging because data that are consistent over space and time are lacking. We used the U.S. National Land Cover Dataset Land Cover Change Retrofit Product and North American Breeding Bird Survey data to examine land-cover change and its associations with diversity of birds with principally terrestrial life cycles (landbirds) in the conterminous United States. We used mixed-effects models and model selection to rank associations by ecoregion. Land cover in 3.22\% of the area considered in our analyses changed from 1992 to 2001, and changes in species richness and abundance of birds were strongly associated with land-cover changes. Changes in species richness and abundance were primarily associated with changes in nondominant types of land cover, yet in many ecoregions different types of land cover were associated with species richness than were associated with abundance. Conversion of natural land cover to anthropogenic land cover was more strongly associated with changes in bird species richness and abundance than persistence of natural land cover in nearly all ecoregions and different covariates were most strongly associated with species richness than with abundance in 11 of 17 ecoregions. Loss of grassland and shrubland affected bird species richness and abundance in forested ecoregions. Loss of wetland was associated with bird abundance in forested ecoregions. Our findings highlight the value of understanding changes in nondominant land cover types and their association with bird diversity in the United States.},

The primary knockdown involved aerial baiting with para-aminopropiophenone (PAPP) in meat baits. The efficacy of baiting was lower than expected resulting in trapping and hunting commencing earlier than planned. Cats were successfully eradicated over two weeks. Key to the success of the programme was the identification of a narrow window of low prey availability for cats. Post-eradication monitoring of the two most common seabird species, fairy prions and short-tailed shearwaters (Ardenna tenuirostris), showed positive signs towards population recovery. Prion activity increased three-fold and shearwater breeding success increased.},

Understanding how animals will adapt to climate change requires understanding how climate variables influence their biology year round, and how events in different seasons interact. Migratory birds may be especially vulnerable because of the wide range of geographic areas that they depend on throughout the annual cycle. We examined the potential effects of non-breeding season climate change on the breeding biology of Kirtland's Warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii, formerly Dendroica kirtlandii), an endangered songbird that breeds in the Northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan and winters in the Bahamas. Our objectives were to determine whether spring arrival dates on the breeding grounds correlate with late winter rainfall in non-breeding areas and whether this has consequences for reproductive success. We used data on spring arrival dates and number of fledglings per year, sampling many individuals across multiple years, to show that males arrive on breeding grounds later following drier winters.

The project was designed to help determine why grassland bird populations in the southern Great Plains are experiencing widespread and rapid declines. One of our objectives was to determine the effects of contemporary fire and grazing regimes on the nesting ecology of birds breeding in tallgrass prairie. From 1993 to 1995 we monitored nests on six 16.2-hectare plots at The Nature Conservancy' s Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Osage County, Oklahoma. Three of these plots were undisturbed (unburned and ungrazed), and three were disturbed (burned and/or grazed) during each year of the study. We monitored nesting success, clutch size, and fledging rates at each of 313 Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna), Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), and Dickcissel (Spiza americana) nests on the six plots. We observed 42, 12, and 87 Eastern Meadowlark, Grasshopper Sparrow, and Dick-cissel nests, respectively, on undisturbed plots and 60, 26, and 86 nests, respectively, on disturbed plots. On undisturbed plots, the average Mayfield probabilities of nesting success for the incubation and brood-rearing periods combined were 0.17, 0.17, and 0.19 for Eastern Meadowlarks, Grasshopper Sparrows, and Dickcissels, respectively: the average probabilities of success on disturbed plots were 0.07, 0.06, and 0.06, respectively. Clutch sizes and fledging rates from successful nests were not statistically different between plot types. These results suggest that physiologically the reproductive performance of these species was not affected by burning and grazing; however, rates of nesting success for Eastern Meadowlarks and Dickcissels may be negatively affected by these activities. Through cooperative efforts with private landowners, we are currently developing management recommendations to mitigate the effects of burning and grazing on these species.},

Drawing on such data for North America, Rosenberg et al. report wide-spread population declines of birds over the past half-century, resulting in the cumulative loss of billions of breeding individuals across a wide range of species and habitats. They show that declines are not restricted to rare and threatened species—those once considered common and wide-spread are also diminished. These results have major implications for ecosystem integrity, the conservation of wildlife more broadly, and policies associated with the protection of birds and native ecosystems on which they depend.Science, this issue p. 120Species extinctions have defined the global biodiversity crisis, but extinction begins with loss in abundance of individuals that can result in compositional and functional changes of ecosystems. Using multiple and independent monitoring networks, we report population losses across much of the North American avifauna over 48 years, including once-common species and from most biomes. Integration of range-wide population trajectories and size estimates indicates a net loss approaching 3 billion birds, or 29\% of 1970 abundance. A continent-wide weather radar network also reveals a similarly steep decline in biomass passage of migrating birds over a recent 10-year period. This loss of bird abundance signals an urgent need to address threats to avert future avifaunal collapse and associated loss of ecosystem integrity, function, and services.}

This discrepancy is driven by protected area placement that does not cover the full annual cycle of migratory species, indicating that global efforts toward coordinated conservation planning for migrants are yet to bear fruit. Better-targeted investment and enhanced coordination among countries are needed to conserve migratory species throughout their migratory cycle.}

Here, we combined range-wide information about migratory connectivity with global remote-sensing data to quantify the relative importance of breeding and non-breeding environmental processes to persistent long-term population declines of a migratory songbird, the wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina). Consistent with theoretical predictions about population limitation of migratory birds, our results suggest that habitat loss and climate have contributed to the observed declines in wood thrush breeding abundance, yet the relative importance of breeding versus non-breeding factors is population-specific. For example, high-abundance core breeding populations appear to be more limited by habitat loss, whereas low-abundance, peripheral populations appear to be limited by climate-driven seasonal interactions. Further, our analysis indicates that the relative impact of breeding habitat loss is at least three to six times greater than the impact of equivalent nonbreeding habitat loss and therefore the steepest regional declines have likely been driven by the loss of breeding habitat. These results underscore the need for population-specific conservation strategies implemented throughout the annual cycle to reverse long-term declines.},

  abstract = {Although widespread throughout the interior foothills of central and northern California, Pinus sabiniana Dougl. has a disjunct distribution in the southern Sierra Nevada, where it is abundant in the Kern River and Tule River watersheds, but is absent from the Kaweah River watershed between 36u and 37uN. This gap in the pine’s distribution has long intrigued botanists and ecologists and has elicited a number of hypotheses for this anomalous biogeographical pattern. Here we propose a new hypothesis that couples unique features of the southern Sierra Nevada topography with unique features of P. sabiniana’s response to fire. This low elevation pine is widely distributed in grassland and chaparral, and where it occurs with the latter vegetation, it is extremely vulnerable to high intensity wildfires. Under these conditions, meta-populations persist over time in refugia in riparian areas and during fire-free intervals expand outwards re-colonizing shrubland dominated slopes. The lack of such refugia in the very steep and narrow Kaweah drainage is hypothesized to explain the absence of this pine in that area. To test this hypothesis, we studied the age-structure of P. sabiniana in the area of the 2002 McNally Fire in the Kern drainage to compare age distributions of trees and tree skeletons along a gradient up slope away from riparian zones. Maximum age declined significantly with distance from riparian areas, suggesting that past fires have eliminated P. sabiniana from the slopes and that the pines have re-colonized during fire-free intervals. The relationship was strongest when our data were restricted to areas that had a previously recorded fire. We also found that the riparian areas in the Kern drainage were significantly wider than those in Kaweah drainage, suggesting that fewer such fire refugia exist in the latter watershed, and providing an explanation for the lack of P. sabiniana between 36u and 37u.},

  abstract = {Expansion of anthropogenic noise and night~lighting across our planet1,2 is of increasing conservation concern3–6. Despite growing knowledge of physiological and behavioural responses to these stimuli from single-species and local-scale studies, whether these pollutants affect fitness is less clear, as is how and why species vary in their sensitivity to these anthropic stressors. Here we leverage a large citizen science dataset paired with high-resolution noise and light data from across the contiguous United States to assess how these stimuli affect reproductive success in 142 bird species. We find responses to both sensory pollutants linked to the functional traits and habitat affiliations of species. For example, overall nest success was negatively correlated with noise among birds in closed environments. Species-specific changes in reproductive timing and hatching success in response to noise exposure were explained by vocalization frequency, nesting location and diet. Additionally, increased light-gathering ability of species’ eyes was associated with stronger advancements in reproductive timing in response to light exposure, potentially creating phenological mismatches7. Unexpectedly, better light-gathering ability was linked to reduced clutch failure and increased overall nest success in response to light exposure, raising important questions about how responses to sensory pollutants counteract or exacerbate responses to other aspects of global change, such as climate warming. These findings demonstrate that anthropogenic noise and light can substantially affect breeding bird phenology and fitness, and underscore the need to consider sensory pollutants alongside traditional dimensions of the environment that typically inform biodiversity conservation. Human-generated noise and night~lighting affect breeding habits and fitness in birds, implying that sensory pollutants must be considered alongside other environmental factors in assessing biodiversity conservation.},

  abstract = {Cities and surrounding suburbs are Earth's fastest growing land use. Urban impervious surfaces affect hydrological and energy balances, as well as biological composition and functioning of ecosystems. Although datasets have been produced documenting urban growth at multiple time periods in coarse intervals, there remains an unmet need for observations spanning multiple decades at high frequency. We have developed an empirical method for retrieving annual, long-term continuous fields of impervious surface cover from the Landsat archive and applied it to the Washington, D.C.–Baltimore, MD megalopolis from 1984 to 2010. Fitting and applying a single regression model over time, the method relies on a multi-annual training sample of high-resolution impervious cover layers tied to coincident intra- and inter-annual Landsat image composites. These predictor images are composited and normalized to maximize discrimination of impervious surfaces from intermittently bare agricultural fields and minimize inter-annual variation due to phenology, solar illumination, and atmospheric noise. Excluding the year 2009 due to lack of data availability resulting from nearly continual winter snow cover, the resulting dataset is a continuous-field representation of impervious surface cover at 30-m horizontal and annual temporal resolution from 1984 to 2010. Average error was approximately ±6\% cover, with outliers due to shadows from large buildings in winter images. The region's impervious surface cover grew from 881 to 1176±11km2 over the 27-year span—an average annual gain of approximately 11±2km2/year—with great variability among local municipalities in terms of rate of development. Patterns including intensification (i.e., “infill”) and expansion (i.e., exurban or “sprawl”) of development, as well as fragmentation and isolation of natural areas were clearly visible in the data at various places and times. Neither impervious surface loss nor deceleration of growth were observed in any of the cities or counties over the study span. These findings show that empirical retrieval of impervious coverage at the spatial and temporal scale of the Landsat archive is possible using dense time-stacks of calibrated Landsat images, and that long-term records such as this can provide new opportunities for analyzing land-use patterns and their underlying causes to improve understanding of socio-economic processes and human–environment interactions.},

  abstract = {The discovery of radar and the start of radar aeroecology During World War II radar (RAdio Detection and Ranging) was developed as a way to track enemy aircraft, but was soon recognized as a potential tool for ecological research. Military reports had shown that 'angels' or 'phantoms' observed by military radar could be attributed to birds based on concomitant visual observations. It was only after the war that non-military applications for the new technology could be explored and published, including ecological research (Brooks 1945, Lack and Varley 1945), as well as meteorological applications (Maynard 1945). The fact that radar originally designed for air and marine surveillance and defence could be used to measure aerial movement of animals, was an exciting revelation for ecologists but a consternation for engineers that were trying to rid their monitoring systems of unwanted noise. For radar operators, trying to identify enemy aircraft was especially challenging when the radar screen was saturated by millions of tiny unexplained echoes on a night of mass bird migration (Fox and Beasley 2010). The first pioneers willing to explore this new technology realised that radar could reveal information about flight behaviour and aerial biomass of birds and insects (Bonham and Blake 1956) like no other tool available at that time and at spatial scales which could not be studied otherwise. Even today, more than half a century later, radars are one of the best tools for measuring aerial biomass flows. Radar aeroecology is a fast-growing inter-disciplinary field focusing on aerial movement of organisms and their interactions with the aerial environment. While the term 'aeroecology' was coined by Kunz et al. (2008), the field of radar aeroecology actually began in the 1940s. In the early years of radar aeroecology, researchers studied migration by spending hours in front of a radar monitor in a dark room or mobile radar unit. Researchers filmed radar screens or took time lapse photographs which had to be developed before they could be sure migration was actually occurring, a technique which continued into the 1990s (Bruderer 1971, Alerstam and Ulfstrand 1972, Buurma 1987, Alfiya 1995) (Fig. 1a).

  abstract = {Biodiversity is changing at an unprecedented rate, and long-term monitoring is key to quantifying these changes and identifying their drivers (1, 2). Weather radars are an essential tool for meeting these goals. However, recent policy changes make vital data unavailable. Data policy should be adjusted to take into account the broad role that weather radars play beyond meteorology. In addition to providing essential meteorological data for weather forecasts, flood risk planning, storm warnings, and atmospheric and climatological research (3, 4), weather radars detect trillions of insects, bats, and birds in the air (5, 6). By collecting such data, they could provide an unrecognized service to society: long-term standardized monitoring of aerial biomass flows (7). In the United States, weather radar data have already been used at a continental scale for these purposes (6, 8). However, similar efforts in Europe (9, 10) are now fundamentally threatened. The Operational Programme for the Exchange of Weather Radar Information (OPERA) coordinates the exchange of radar data among European national meteorological services (11). It serves as a central hub for accessing weather radar data in Europe, allowing those in search of data to make one request instead of contacting each meteorological service separately. However, because of budget cuts and resulting prioritization of meteorological products, OPERA now requests that national meteorological services submit cleaned rather than uncleaned polar volume radar data (12). Uncleaned radar data include both meteorological and biological signals, whereas cleaned data exclude biological signals. OPERA is currently establishing new centers for European weather radar data that could serve as ideal access points for diverse users and stakeholders. Access to uncleaned polar volume data at these data centers would boost their utility for aerial biodiversity monitoring and other multidisciplinary applications. To make this possible, OPERA should revise its data exchange policy to require that all countries submit uncleaned radar data, and Europe must build adequate data infrastructure to transfer and store the full data. National and international funding schemes and policy-makers such as the EU Commission should recognize and stimulate diverse applications of weather radar data, and OPERA should establish an open access data archive, which would facilitate long-term multidisciplinary research and biodiversity monitoring. If all regional associations of the World Meteorological Organization adopted similar policies, weather radars could be used for aerial biodiversity monitoring worldwide.}

To reduce this mortality, it is essential to provide an objective assessment of the relative collision threat posed by glass and other materials incorporating patterns intended to deter collisions, similar to ratings for insulation value and breaking strength, for use by building professionals such as architects, engineers, planners, and other decision makers. We wanted to determine whether we could use a non-injurious binomial choice test developed in Austria, with local bird taxa in Pennsylvania, to provide objective collision threat ratings. Preliminary work in 2010-11 tested three patterns tested in Austria in 2004-6 and produced virtually identical scores leading to the conclusion that the test should apply generally to passerines. Additional trials indicated that variables including dimensions of pattern elements, spacing and orientation may interact in producing tunnel scores. The tunnel test has the potential to: a) determine how size, orientation and spacing of pattern elements impact collision-reduction effectiveness, b) rate commercially available glass, and c) evaluate new bird-friendly technologies.},

Adult survival and fecundity were lower in El Niño years and higher in La Niña years. Fecundity, in turn, was positively correlated with subsequent recruitment of new individuals into winter and breeding populations. These findings demonstrate that migratory birds can be affected by shifts in global climate patterns and emphasize the need to know how events throughout the annual cycle interact to determine population size.}

  abstract = {The mechanisms underlying evolutionary changes in sexual dimorphism have long been of interest to biologists. A striking gradient in sexual dichromatism exists among songbirds in North America, including the wood-warblers (Parulidae): males are generally more colourful than females at northern latitudes, while the sexes are similarly ornamented at lower latitudes. We use phylogenetically controlled comparative analysis to test three non-mutually exclusive hypotheses for the evolution of sexual dichromatism among wood-warblers. The first two hypotheses focus on the loss of female coloration with the evolution of migration, either owing to the costs imposed by visual predators during migration, or owing to the relaxation of selection for female social signalling at higher latitudes. The third hypothesis focuses on whether sexual dichromatism evolved owing to changes in male ornamentation as the strength of sexual selection increases with breeding latitude. To test these hypotheses, we compared sexual dichromatism to three variables: the presence of migration, migration distance, and breeding latitude. We found that the presence of migration and migration distance were both positively correlated with sexual dichromatism, but models including breeding latitude alone were not strongly supported. Ancestral state reconstruction supports the hypothesis that the ancestral wood-warblers were monochromatic, with both colourful males and females. Combined, these results are consistent with the hypotheses that the evolution of migration is associated with the relaxation of selection for social signalling among females and that there are increased predatory costs along longer migratory routes for colourful females. These results suggest that loss of female ornamentation can be a driver of sexual dichromatism and that social or natural selection may be a stronger contributor to variation in dichromatism than sexual selection.},

Here, we present data from an extensive field study, which shows that migration in a freshwater fish (roach, Rutilus rutilus) that commonly migrates from lakes to streams during winter confers a significant survival benefit with respect to bird (cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo spp.) predation. We tagged over 2000 individual fish in two Scandinavian lakes over 4 years and monitored migratory behaviour using passive telemetry. Next, we calculated the predation vulnerability of fish with differing migration strategies, by recovering data from passive integrated transponder tags of fish eaten by cormorants at communal roosts close to the lakes. We show that fish can reduce their predation risk from cormorants by migrating into streams, and that probability of being preyed upon by cormorants is positively related to the time individuals spend in the lake during winter. Our data add to the growing body of evidence that highlights the importance of predation for migratory dynamics, and, to our knowledge, is one of the first studies to directly quantify a predator avoidance benefit to migrants in the field.},

Changes in a hemlock-dominated forest following woolly adelgid infestation in southern New England. J. Torrey Bot. 132: 458–470. 2005.—The hemlock wooly adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae), a small aphid-like insect introduced from Japan, has caused widespread hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) mortality throughout the mid-Atlantic and southern New England region over the last twenty years. We examined long-term (1952–2002) changes in hemlock-dominated stands before and after the appearance of the HWA in 1987 in the Connecticut College Arboretum, southeastern Connecticut. With HWA infestation, basal area of T. canadensis declined dramatically, dropping 70\% from 1982 to 2002. Forest communities responded to the elimination of the dominant species by quickly filling various sized gaps. Black oaks (Quercus velutina, Q. coccinea, Q. rubra) increased from 28\% of canopy basal area in 1982 to 41\% in 2002. Sapling density increased markedly following HWA infestation, from 80 stems/ha in 1982 to nearly 5600 in 2002, with greatest increase in Sassafras albidum (0 to 1900 stems/ha) and Acer rubrum (4 to 1100 stems/ha). Ledge and ravine communities, formerly dominated by T. canadensis, became more compositionally distinct, with greater importance of black oaks on more xeric ledge sites and mixed canopy dominance in mesic ravine sites. Major trends associated with the decline of T. canadensis included a shift in canopy dominance to oak and mixed hardwoods, considerable understory development, including greater herb richness and abundance and increased density of clonal saplings, and expansion of several invasive shrubs and woody vines.},

We matched these results with island attributes to highlight feasible island conservation opportunities. We identified 1362 threatened breeding seabird populations on 968 islands. On 803 (83\%) of these islands, we identified threatening invasive species (20\%), incomplete protected area coverage (23\%), or both (40\%). Most islands with threatened seabirds are amenable to island-wide conservation action because they are small (57\% were {$<$}1 km2), uninhabited (74\%), and occur in high- or middle-income countries (96\%). Collectively these attributes make islands with threatened seabirds a rare opportunity for effective conservation at scale.

  abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation are recognized as major threats to biodiversity. Their respective effects, however, are sometimes not well distinguished, even though habitat loss is recognized as the most important source of variation affecting species abundance and richness at the landscape scale. As 'habitat' is a species-specific concept (based on species perception of its environment), habitat loss and fragmentation studies should be conducted on a species-specific basis. We here assessed the influence of habitat loss and fragmentation in the context of a boreal forest considering forest clearcutting as an anthropogenic disturbance inducing mature forest loss and fragmentation that has a potential impact on wildlife. Using 16 simulated patterns of mature forest loss and fragmentation and three natural landscapes as replicates, we assessed the respective influence of forest loss and fragmentation on the abundance of 10 bird species common in the boreal forest of eastern Canada. Species-habitat relationships were modeled through habitat use models that were utilized to predict abundance of the 10 species within each combination of loss and fragmentation patterns (3 landscapes × 16 patterns). We used three-way ANOVAs to assess the effects of mature forest loss, fragmentation and replicates (random effect) on species abundance. Our results indicated that: (1) variation in species abundance mostly depended on mature forest loss, followed by static landscape attributes other than cutovers (e.g. streams, lakes, roads) and finally by fragmentation and (2) responses to mature forest loss and fragmentation differed among species, not necessary in relation to the successional status but in relation to their perception of their environment. Decreasing detrimental effects of mature forest loss through conservation of large continuous patches of forest may be suitable to maintain abundances of mature forest bird species. Our results highlight that studies aiming to quantify effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on wildlife should be conducted on a species-specific basis and use several landscape replicates to avoid potentially biased results. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Globally, agriculture has intensified during the past 50 years due to increased mechanization, changes in the timing of farming operations, grassland conversion to cropland, and increased agrochemical inputs. Birds associated with farmlands and grasslands in North America have experienced severe declines over the last several decades, prompting the need for a comprehensive review of the drivers, mechanisms and magnitude of effects on bird populations. Here we evaluated changes in North American farmland bird populations over time and conducted a systematic review and analysis of the published literature to identify the major causes. Based on North American Breeding Bird Survey data, populations of 57 of 77 (74\%) farmland-associated species decreased from 1966 to 2013. Multiple species exhibited highly congruent declines during the 1960s-1980s − a period with rapid changes in farming practices to low tillage systems, heavy pesticide use and widespread conversion of grassland habitat to cropland. The most severe declines occurred in aerial insectivorous birds (average change of −39.5\% from 1966 to 2013), followed by grassland (‐20.8\%) and shrubland (‐16.5\%) bird species. Direct agricultural drivers impacting bird abundance, survival, and reproduction include loss of natural habitats, interference from farming equipment, and direct mortality or sublethal effects from pesticide exposure. Subtle interference with behaviour or physiology are reported through indirect drivers such as reduced food supplies, sublethal pesticide toxicity, habitat fragmentation and alteration, and disturbance. Indirect effects are likely significant for many species, particularly aerial insectivores, but detailed mechanistic studies are lacking. Our review of 122 studies found that pesticides (42\% of all studies), followed by habitat loss or alterations (27\%), were most predominant in negatively affecting farmland birds, with pesticides (93\% negative) and mowing/harvesting (81\% negative) having the most consistently negative effects. Modifications to farmland management such as reducing pesticide inputs through integrated pest management and maintaining or restoring uncultivated field margins and native habitat could positively influence farmland birds without significantly reducing agricultural crop yields.},

  abstract = {The spatial distribution of a natural resource is an important consideration in designing an efficient survey or monitoring program for the resource. Generally, sample sites that are spatially balanced, that is, more or less evenly dispersed over the extent of the resource, are more efficient than simple random sampling. We review a unified strategy for selecting spatially balanced probability samples of natural resources. The technique is based on creating a function that maps two-dimensional space into one-dimensional space, thereby defining an ordered spatial address. We use a restricted randomization to randomly order the addresses, so that systematic sampling along the randomly ordered linear structure results in a spatially well-balanced random sample. Variable inclusion probability, proportional to an arbitrary positive ancillary variable, is easily accommodated. The basic technique selects points in a two-dimensional continuum, but is also applicable to sampling finite populations or one-dimensional continua embedded in two-dimensional space. An extension of the basic technique gives a way to order the sample points so that any set of consecutively numbered points is in itself a spatially well-balanced sample. This latter property is extremely useful in adjusting the sample for the frame imperfections common in environmental sampling.},

As case studies of the effect of climate change on bird migration, I analyzed two long-term data sets of arrival times for eight species of northern breeding migratory wood warblers (Parulidae) gathered over a 100 year period in east-central Illinois (IL, USA) and a 40 year period in western Minnesota (MN, USA). Six (IL) and seven (MN) of the wood warbler species showed no significant tendency to migrate earlier in response to earlier springs in their breeding range. These results suggest that climate change may force many species of long-distance migratory songbirds to become uncoupled in the spring from their food resources that are driven by temperature.},

Despite strong observational evidence, experimental work is needed to strengthen support for this hypothesis. We experimentally upgraded individual American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) from low-quality second-growth scrub habitat to high-quality mangrove forest habitat by permanently removing behaviorally dominant, primarily adult males from mangrove, allowing females and immature males from scrub to colonize vacated territories. Prior to the manipulation, upgraded and control redstarts had stable-carbon isotope values in their blood indicative of scrub habitat occupancy and were comparable in body mass. Relative to control birds that overwintered exclusively in scrub, upgraded redstarts incorporated mangrove isotopic signatures, maintained body mass from winter to spring, departed earlier on spring migration, and returned at a higher rate in the following winter. Furthermore, insect biomass on upgrade territories was significantly greater than on control territories, suggesting food availability as a proximate mechanism underlying gradients of nonbreeding habitat suitability. Findings here demonstrate that winter habitat occupancy can be an important determinant of individual performance in migratory birds. Restricted access to food-rich winter habitats may limit survival of females and immature males, an outcome that could be an important driver of population structure and dynamics.},

We compared specialist butterfly population indices at three sites where a permanent non-fire refugium (a unit kept unburned through cycles of rotational fire elsewhere in the site) was established during this study to indices at comparison sites (which had consistent management throughout this study) in the same region. At Crex Meadows (12,180 ha), all significant changes in specialist numbers skewed toward relatively higher abundance in the refugium (14 ha, last burned in 1988) during the later period (1998--2005) versus 10 comparison subsites (fire-managed in both periods) than expected from observations in the earlier period (1991--97). The same pattern occurred in the refugium (4 ha) at Bauer-Brockway (125 ha), after the rest of that unit (9 ha) had its first management fire. Population trends were positive in these refugia, while the comparison sites usually had less favorable trends, or otherwise had similar trends. At Muralt Bluff (25 ha), regal fritillaries (Speyeria idalia) were more concentrated in the refugium (3 ha, last burned in 1991) during the earlier period but were more abundant in both periods in the refugium than the other units there (fire-managed in both periods). In the earlier period at Muralt Bluff, this species significantly declined, the opposite trend of comparison sites (which always had never-burned refugia), but significantly increased in the later period, similar to comparison sites. The refugium did not benefit Ottoe skipper (Hesperia ottoe), which declined significantly in the earlier period and was not recorded in the later period. Formerly burned units began functioning as refugia only {$>$}6--8 years after last fire and continued to increase in benefit for years after that. In fire-managed and fire-prone sites, we recommend the creation of permanent non-fire refugia for Lepidoptera conservation, placed where the most specialists will benefit and managed unintensively (e.g. mowing) if needed.},

  abstract = {Social information use in songbird habitat selection commonly involves a conspecific attraction strategy. Individuals copy the breeding-site choices of conspecifics, that is, bias their own settlement decisions towards sites (tracts of spatially limited habitat with similar structure) already occupied by others. In order to be adaptive, social information use has to be discriminative. Especially the decisions of good quality individuals, i.e. measuring high at observable fitness correlates, should be copied more frequently than those of poor quality individuals. It is unknown, however, whether songbirds discriminatively use conspecific presence by evaluating the quality of information providers in habitat selection. We experimentally tested whether wood warblers Phylloscopus sibilatrix selectively copied settlement decisions of conspecifics in relation to the quality of observed individuals. We also tested whether the use of social cues was influenced by the population density at a particular site in the preceding year. We found that wood warblers selectively used intraspecific social information, but in a pattern opposite to that expected based on existing hypotheses. Wood warblers copied breeding-site choices of poor quality conspecifics and despite temporary attraction to sites where the presence of good quality individuals was simulated, they did not ultimately settle near these individuals. Population density in the preceding year did not influence settlement patterns. We argue that when making settlement decisions, wood warblers assessed the expected level of local intraspecific competition and selectively copied breeding-site choices of conspecifics or refused to settle, depending on competitive abilities of observed individuals. This adds a novel aspect to the patterns and processes of social information use proposed thus far, and provides support for the predicted negative effect of intraspecific competition on benefit of information. Moreover, it seems that habitat selection in wood warblers is a complex decision-making process, in which initial decisions are adjusted after acquiring more accurate information.

Curiously, whether insect and bird declines are causally linked has received little empirical attention. Here, we hypothesize that insect declines are an important factor contributing to the decline of insectivorous birds. We further suggest that insect populations essential to insectivorous birds decline whenever non-native lumber, ornamental, or invasive plant species replace native plant communities. We support our hypothesis by reviewing studies that show (1) due to host plant specialization, insect herbivores typically do poorly on non-native plants; (2) birds are often food limited; (3) populations of insectivorous bird species fluctuate with the supply of essential insect prey; (4) not all arthropod prey support bird reproduction equally well; and (5) terrestrial birds for which insects are an essential source of food have declined by 2.9 billion individuals over the last 50 years, while terrestrial birds that do not depend on insects during their life history have gained by 26.2 million individuals, a 111-fold difference. Understanding the consequences of insect declines, particularly as they affect charismatic animals like birds, may motivate land managers, homeowners, and restoration ecologists to take actions that reverse these declines by favoring the native plant species that support insect herbivores most productively.},

  abstract = {Managing fire regimes for conservation of biodiversity is a global challenge. We examined the responses of birds to fire mosaics (4-km diameter landscapes) comprising different compositions of fire age-classes, and used these results to evaluate the relative value of four contemporary strategies for fire management. These were: (1) promoting a diverse range of age-classes; (2) promoting particular age-classes for fire-sensitive species; (3) preventing reserve-scale wildfire; and (4) burning a fixed percentage (e.g. 5\%) of the landscape annually. None of the 28 species examined was positively associated with landscapes with extensive recently burned ({$<$}10. years) vegetation. One species was associated with landscapes with a greater diversity of age-classes while two species, including the endangered Black-eared Miner (Manorina melanotis), were associated with less diverse landscapes. Landscapes with extensive older ({$>$}35. years since fire) vegetation were favoured by three species; while two species preferred those with extensive mid-age (11-35. years since fire) vegetation. Our findings suggest that in semi-arid mallee ecosystems, management that results in large proportions of recently burned vegetation (e.g. by burning 5\% of the landscape annually or permitting reserve-scale wildfires), or a high local diversity of age-classes, will negatively affect more bird species than they would aid. Management strategies that promote particular age-classes (i.e. mid-age and older vegetation) are likely to benefit bird species. Species-specific knowledge from a landscape perspective can refine management strategies to assist in defining the characteristics of 'desirable' fire mosaics for maintaining biodiversity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Effective pathogen management, as an aspect of agroecological crop protection (ACP) necessitates the replacement of copper (Cu) fungicides, but there is little knowledge relating to the performance of potentially suitable alternatives in large-scale, open-field agricultural settings. The present study was aimed at investigating the potential of Equisetum arvense (horsetail macerate) compared to Cu-based treatments for the control of Solanum lycopersicum. and Triticum turgidum ssp. durum fungal pathogens in established organic commercial farms located in Emilia Romagna (Italy) over a three-year period (2017–2019). Both the Cu-based and horsetail foliar sprays were routinely applied as preventative treatments and in the event of pathogen establishment as curative treatments. The Cu-based and horsetail macerate treatments were both equally effective at significantly reducing Phytophthora infestans (late blight) and increasing yield in tomato compared to the untreated control. For durum wheat, the horsetail macerate and Cu-based treatments were successful at significantly reducing Puccinia triticina (brown rust) infection and increasing yield under moderate infection, but unsuccessful under unfavorable meteorological conditions resulting in the combined and severe spread of Puccinia triticina, Fusarium graminearum, and Zymoseptoria tritici. From the present results, horsetail macerate is a promising and suitable Cu-free ACP alternative for late blight management of tomato.},

The focus of this study is a large and relatively homogeneous wintertime roost of American Robins (Turdus migratorius) in central Oklahoma. Radar observations are used to estimate the roost population through winter 2010–2011, and the population time series is related to weather variables and radar beam propagation. Radar-estimated roost population gradually increased to an estimated peak of 1.5–2 million individuals from November 2010 to January 2011, and then decreased in a more stepwise manner through the spring until roost dispersal in early March. Weather conditions did not definitively explain these population decreases leading toward roost dispersal. Birds from the roost were often observed to travel {$>$}50 km away during the daytime. About 25–30\% of the variability in the radar-derived roost population estimate could be explained by atmospheric variables. This work provides an example of how radar methods may be used to estimate populations and monitor their temporal trends, which may be valuable to conservation efforts by facilitating estimates of population change through time.},

  abstract = {Billions of nocturnally migrating birds move through increasingly photopolluted skies, relying on cues for navigation and orientation that artificial light at night (ALAN) can impair. However, no studies have quantified avian responses to powerful ground-based light sources in urban areas. We studied effects of ALAN on migrating birds by monitoring the beams of the National September 11 Memorial \& Museum's "Tribute in Light" in New York, quantifying behavioral responses with radar and acoustic sensors and modeling disorientation and attraction with simulations. This single light source induced significant behavioral alterations in birds, even in good visibility conditions, in this heavily photopolluted environment, and to altitudes up to 4 km. We estimate that the installation influenced ≈1.1 million birds during our study period of 7 d over 7 y. When the installation was illuminated, birds aggregated in high densities, decreased flight speeds, followed circular flight paths, and vocalized frequently. Simulations revealed a high probability of disorientation and subsequent attraction for nearby birds, and bird densities near the installation exceeded magnitudes 20 times greater than surrounding baseline densities during each year's observations. However, behavioral disruptions disappeared when lights were extinguished, suggesting that selective removal of light during nights with substantial bird migration is a viable strategy for minimizing potentially fatal interactions among ALAN, structures, and birds. Our results also highlight the value of additional studies describing behavioral patterns of nocturnally migrating birds in powerful lights in urban areas as well as conservation implications for such lighting installations.},

  abstract = {For several decades, many grassland bird species have been declining in abundance throughout the Midwest and Great Plains regions of the United States, possibly due to loss of natural grassland habitat and increasing urbanization. I used 20 years of data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey to identify increasing, decreasing, and stable populations of 36 grassland-nesting bird species. I characterized the immediate landscape (circle with radius = 30 km) surrounding each population based on data from the National Resources Inventory. For each landscape, I calculated the proportion of eight different land-cover types: restored grassland, rangeland, cultivated cropland, pasture, noncultivated cropland, forest, urban land, and water. Using a null model, I compared landscape composition of increasing, decreasing, and stable populations. As predicted on the basis of the habitat preferences of grassland birds, increasing populations inhabited landscapes that contained significantly more restored grassland and rangeland but significantly less forest land and urban land than landscapes inhabited by decreasing populations. There was no significant difference in the proportion of cropland within the landscapes of increasing and decreasing populations, although cropland composed a large proportion ({$>$}30\%) of many landscapes. In contrast, restored grassland typically composed a very small proportion ({$<$}3.5\%) of total land cover, yet it was significantly more common in the landscapes of increasing than decreasing populations. These results suggest that grassland birds may benefit from government initiatives, such as the Conservation Reserve Program, that promote the restoration of grassland at a landscape scale.},

Add to that figure the vast area converted to habitats of low intensity agriculture and grasslands become second only to the oceans in terms of direct dominance of the planet' s ecosystems. They govern, directly, the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of neoole."-C. Imboden (i988:vii). Research on and interest in grassland birds have increased considerably in the past 20 yr. There are several reasons for this heightened interest. Foremost, it is clear that populations of many grassland birds have declined sharply throughout the Western Hemisphere (e.g. and Sauer 1999). In North America, populations of at least 13 species of grassland birds declined significantly between 1966 and 1995 (Peterjohn and Sauer 1999). And as a group, North Amer-ican grassland birds have experienced "steeper, more consistent, and more geographically widespread declines than any other behavioral or ecological guild," largely because of habitat loss and degradation (Knopf 1994:251). Similar declines are also occurring in South America, where species such as Pampas Meadowlark (StumelZu dejilippii; Tubaro and Gabelli 1999), Saffron-cowled Blackbird (Agelaius jlavus; Fra-ga et al. 1998), and Sporophila seedeaters (Silva 1999) have declined in the past 20 yr. Indeed, Collar et al. (1992:35) describe the "near-total destruction of open grasslands in southeast Bra-zil. . and in the vast central planalto. . as one of the great ecological catastrophes in South America." Another reason for the increased research interest in grassland birds is changing agricultural practices. For example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture' s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which has taken more than 14 million ha of cropland out of production under IO-yr contracts , has made it possible to examine regional, and even continental, effects of changing landscapes on grassland birds (e.g., Lauber 1991, Reynolds et al. 1994, Herkert 1998). Additionally , the CRP has provided excellent opportunities to study bird colonization, habitat use, and nesting success in different regions and under different ecological conditions. Finally, grassland birds are also fascinating from ecological and evolutionary perspectives. Distinctive or un-2 usual adaptations, such as large body size and cursorial habits, have evolved in grassland birds. And the ability to readily observe many behaviors makes these species ideal for research (e.g., Wheelwright and Mauck 1998). GRASSLAND HABITATS IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE Grassland ecosystems occur in a variety of forms and are affected by geology, geography, moisture, soil type, elevation, climate, and disturbance regime (Kantrud 1981, Vickery et al. in press). In this volume, we define a grassland habitat as any extensive area that is dominated by more than 50\% grass (Poaceae) or sedge (Cy-peraceae) cover and that generally has few scattered shrubs ({$<$} 4 m high) and trees. We have generally excluded habitats that are dominated by more than 50\% shrub cover, such as chap-arral. In addition to such obvious grassland habitats as tallgrass and shortgrass prairies, pampas, and Patagonian grassland, we include sedge-dominated tundra, alpine ridges and barrens, puna, and paramo. We also include the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystems of the southeastern United States and the pine (Pinus spp.) forests and savannas of Mexico because it is clear that several species of birds, among them Bachman' s Sparrow (Aimophih aestivalis), Striped Sparrow (Oriturus superciliosus), and Sierra Madre Sparrow (Xenospiza baileyi), have adapted to the graminoid ground cover beneath these forests. Although these ecosystems are generally viewed as forests, the above species appear to occupy them as a form of grassland, not forest, habitat.},

Easements can provide a range of ecosystem services (ESs), but it is unknown whether conservation easements maintain ES capacities equivalent to public protected areas. Evaluation of the capacity of seven ESs on federal and state protected areas and conservation easements in the USA using spatially-explicit ES models and publicly available data indicated that ES capacities in easements were equal to or greater than capacities within state or federal protected areas for six of seven services and, when bundled together, conservation easements protected greater focal ES capacity than other conservation areas. Economic incentive programmes and regulatory mechanisms may be used to stimulate capacity improvements for surface water regulation, riparian filtration, erosion control, and carbon storage on conservation easements, and landscape-level conservation efforts should (1) continue to protect natural and uninhabited areas that provide ecosystem and biological diversity, (2) expand private conservation efforts close to human population centres, and (3) limit future development to areas with high regulating service capacity that can sustain new population growth.},

Gaston (1998) is suspicious about the model's "good fit with empirical observations." The history of science teaches us, however, that the other part of Gaston's opening statement--that the observations "otherwise are difficult to explain"--is as important to scientists in evaluating a model. Although perhaps a fluke, these models at least have the virtue that they provide possible explanations where previously there were none, and as yet there seems to be no strong competing model. Nonetheless, I would not wish to defend this par-ticular model too vigorously. In the longer run it will have to be evaluated empirically. I disagree, howev-er, with the implication made in the closing sentence of Gaston's (1998) commentary that elaborations of the model and its predictions should not made be-fore a better evaluation of the current model is com-pleted. To me, this is as unjustified and shortsighted as would be a charge to cease data collection until a model is perfected. If anything, there would seem to be a greater role for modeling in seabird studies than has been the case in the past. Both data and ideas are needed for progress in our discipline, and often we need to struggle to understand new ideas, as well as new data. As the interplay between them often is less-than-straightforward (e.g. Fagerstrom 1987, Ydenberg and Bertram 1989), seldom is a clear pro-scription possible for what step should be next. In seeking to understand something as complicated as alcid departure strategies, we should explore every avenue of inquiry.},

In this grassland-agriculture matrix, small patch size and proximity to cropland edges did not negatively affect nesting success of these two grassland species of management concern that commonly occur in small patches. Although larger grasslands are necessary to attract area-sensitive species, this work demonstrates the importance of even small grassland patches for nesting habitat in grassland birds. The landscape-scale density of grassland patches in this area may also contribute to the nesting success of these birds. Our results suggest that loss of small grassland patches would have a direct negative effect on population fecundity and an unknown impact through cumulative landscape effects.},

  abstract = {Conservation practice is informed by science, but it also reflects ethical beliefs about how humanity ought to value and interact with Earth's biota. As human activities continue to drive extinctions and diminish critical life-sustaining ecosystem processes, achieving conservation goals becomes increasingly urgent. However, the determination to react decisively can drive conservationists to handle complex challenges without due deliberation, particularly when wildlife individuals are sacrificed for the so-called greater good of wildlife collectives (populations, species, ecosystems). With growing recognition of the widespread sentience and sapience of many nonhuman animals, standard conservation practices that categorically prioritize collectives without due consideration for the well-being of individuals are ethically untenable. Here we highlight 3 overarching ethical orientations characterizing current and historical practices in conservation that suppress compassion: instrumentalism, collectivism, and nativism. We examine how establishing a commitment to compassion could reorient conservation in more ethically expansive directions that incorporate recognition of the intrinsic value of wildlife, the sentience of nonhuman animals, and the values of novel ecosystems, introduced species, and their members. A compassionate conservation approach allays practices that intentionally and unnecessarily harm wildlife individuals, while aligning with critical conservation goals. Although the urgency of achieving effective outcomes for solving major conservation problems may enhance the appeal of quick and harsh measures, the costs are too high. Continuing to justify moral indifference when causing the suffering of wildlife individuals, particularly those who possess sophisticated capacities for emotion, consciousness, and sociality, risks estranging conservation practice from prevailing, and appropriate, social values. As conservationists and compassionate beings, we must demonstrate concern for both the long-term persistence of collectives and the well-being of individuals by prioritizing strategies that do both.},

  abstract = {Species-specific climate responses within ecological communities may disrupt the synchrony of co-evolved mutualisms that are based on the shared timing of seasonal events, such as seed dispersal by ants (myrmecochory). The spring phenology of plants and ants coincides with marked changes in temperature, light and moisture. We investigate how these environmental drivers influence both seed release by early and late spring woodland herb species, and initiation of spring foraging by seed-dispersing ants. We pair experimental herbaceous transplants with artificial ant bait stations across north- and south-facing slopes at two contrasting geographic locations. This use of space enables robust identification of plant fruiting and ant foraging cues, and the use of transplants permits us to assess plasticity in plant phenology. We find that warming temperatures act as the primary phenological cue for plant fruiting and ant foraging. Moreover, the plasticity in plant response across locations, despite transplants being from the same source, suggests a high degree of portability in the seed-dispersing mutualism. However, we also find evidence for potential climate-driven facilitative failure that may lead to phenological asynchrony. Specifically, at the location where the early flowering species (Hepatica nobilis) is decreasing in abundance and distribution, we find far fewer seed-dispersing ants foraging during its fruit set than during that of the later flowering Hexastylis arifolia. Notably, the key seed disperser, Aphaenogaster rudis, fails to emerge during early fruit set at this location. At the second location, A. picea forages equally during early and late seed release. These results indicate that climate-driven changes might shift species-specific interactions in a plant–ant mutualism resulting in winners and losers within the myrmecochorous plant guild.},

  abstract = {Invasive species generally occur and thrive in human-disturbed ecosystems, but Brachyponera chinensis (Asian needle ant, formerly ‘Pachycondyla chinensis’) also invades intact forests. The invasion into native habitats potentially puts B. chinensis in direct competition with the keystone seed-dispersing ants in the genus Aphaenogaster. We observed B. chinensis colonizing artificial nests placed in deciduous forest of the north Georgia Piedmont (US). Their presence appeared to displace existing Aphaenogaster rudis and Reticulitermes flavipes (subterranean termite) colonies. We subsequently mapped the B. chinensis invasion as well as co-existing A. rudis and R. flavipes colonies by examining coarse woody material (CWM) for nesting colonies. We tested whether the B. chinensis invasion changed with forest microclimates, covaried with A. rudis and/or R. flavipes occurrence, and whether it was associated with failed dispersal of a dominant understory herb. Our results and observations suggest that B. chinensis shares ecological niche requirements (temperature, moisture and CWM as nesting habitat) with A. rudis, severely diminishing the abundance of this native ant. In supplanting A. rudis, B. chinensis appears to play an equivalent role to A. rudis as a termite predator, but fails as a seed disperser. Essentially, the invader substitutes for the negative but not the positive species interactions, thereby apparently shifting ecological dynamics in the invaded system.},

For animals that migrate nocturnally, anthropogenic light can interfere with migration routes, flight altitudes, and social activities that accompany migration, such as acoustic communication. We investigated the effect of anthropogenic light on nocturnal migration of birds through the Great Lakes ecosystem. Specifically, we recorded the vocal activity of migrating birds and compared the number of nocturnal flight calls produced above rural areas with ground-level artificial lights compared to nearby areas without lights. We show that more nocturnal flight calls are detected over artificially lit areas. The median number of nocturnal flight calls recorded at sites with artificial lights (31 per night, interquartile range: 15–135) was 3 times higher than at nearby sites without artificial lights (11 per night, interquartile range: 4–39). By contrast, the number of species detected at lit and unlit sites did not differ significantly (artificially lit sites: 6.5 per night, interquartile range: 5.0–8.8; unlit sites: 4.5 per night, interquartile range: 2.0–7.0). We conclude that artificial lighting changes the behavior of nocturnally migrating birds. The increased detections could be a result of ground-level light sources altering bird behavior during migration. For example, birds might have changed their migratory route to pass over lit areas, flown at lower altitudes over lit areas, increased their calling rate over lit areas, or remained longer over lit areas. Our results for ground-level lights correspond to previous findings demonstrating that migratory birds are influenced by lights on tall structures.},

We examined the combined influence of intense herbivory associated with a deer population eruption and chronic herbivory by the post eruption population on the spring flora of Cades Cove, Great Smoky Mountains National Park. During the 1970s the deer population reached a peak of 43 deer per km2, from which it has slowly declined in recent decades. To examine the influence of intense herbivory, we compared the abundance and flowering rates of early flowering plants in Cades Cove to a nearby reference site with similar bedrock geology, vegetation, and disturbance history but contrasting history of deer abundance. Our results suggest that significant changes (p⩽0.05) in the diversity, evenness, and species richness of the spring flora occurred during the eruptive phase. Trillium spp. and other liliaceous species appeared to be disproportionately impacted. Comparisons between control and exclosure plots established after the deer population eruption indicate that recovery has been largely restricted to species that were able to persist under intense herbivory. These species have increased in number in exclosures, suggesting continued impacts by deer on the plant community outside the exclosures. Little to no recolonization by browse sensitive species was observed. Consequently, to restore the natural diversity of early flowering plants once present in Cades Cove, active restoration may be necessary in addition to maintaining deer densities below current levels.},

Dolichonyx oryzivorus (Bobolinks), Sturnella magna (Eastern Meadowlarks), and Passerculus sandwichensis (Savannah Sparrows) were found breeding at the site. Bobolinks were the most abundant grassland obligate, and their nesting success on this site indicates that small grasslands may be just as useful in grassland bird conservation as larger habitat patches. Because large grasslands in New England are few and usually consist of hayfields and pasture, blueberry barrens, military and commercial airports, and landfills, focusing conservation efforts on smaller grasslands as well as large ones seems warranted.},

  abstract = {Symbioses involving arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are among the most important ecological associations for many plant species. The diversity of AMF associated with ferns, however, remains poorly studied. Using recently designed Glomus-specific primers, we surveyed the AMF community associated with ferns from deciduous, broad-leaved second-growth forest habitats at the eastern edge of the piedmont region of central Virginia, USA. Results indicate that this molecular approach may be a useful tool for detecting AMF in ferns compared to traditional techniques based on morphology. Over 30 potential fungal ribotypes were identified from eight fern species using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Fungal ribotypes were found to differ widely in terms of (1) the number of fern partners with which they interact and (2) their relative frequency within each fern. Sequence analysis of fungal isolates from three species of fern indicated that the primers were generally highly specific for Glomus species but some non-target DNA was also amplified. Cloned polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products from Polystichum acrostichoides and Osmunda regalis revealed several phylogenetically distinct Glomus species. A single Glomus species was identified in the cloned PCR products from Botrychium virginianum. These findings challenge the hypothesis that the extent or degree of fern–fungal symbiosis is somehow tied to root complexity. Environmental factors appear to influence the suite of AMF that form partnerships with ferns. Some species of fern from similar habitats associated with dissimilar fungal partners (e.g., P. acrostichoides and Athyrium filix-femina var. asplenioides), whereas others harbored uniform fungal communities (e.g., Asplenium platyneuron). The significance of these data in terms of ecological and evolutionary dynamics of the AMF–fern symbiosis is discussed.},

The United States Department of Agriculture Farm Bill programs have restored some native warm-season grasses (NWSG), but populations of many grassland bird species continue to decline. Market-based NWSG uses focused on hay, pasture, and biofuel feedstock may be more appealing to landowners, and may still provide grassland bird habitat on the landscape. We examined breeding grassland bird occupancy of 102 NWSG production fields including 5 treatments (control [n = 37], grazing [n = 7], hay [n = 22], seed [n = 21], and biofuel [n = 15] production) in Kentucky and Tennessee during 2009–2010 breeding seasons. We used a robust design model in Program MARK to determine occupancy and detection rates for grassland birds. We modeled occupancy differences among treatments and sites (i.e., KY, TN), and included covariates (i.e., field-level vegetation metrics and landscape composition at 3 scales [250 m, 500 m, and 1 km]) for eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), and red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus). Covariates that influenced occupancy included treatment (field sparrow, 2009 only), site (eastern meadowlark, grasshopper sparrow, and northern bobwhite), percent NWSG cover (positive, red-winged blackbird), and percent forest cover within 250 m (negative for eastern meadowlark, grasshopper sparrow, northern bobwhite, and red-winged blackbird) or within 1 km (negative, field sparrow). Our results suggest that forest cover in the surrounding landscape negatively influences species occupancy, and species occupancy generally did not differ among NWSG production treatments. These treatments could be an alternative means to provide grassland bird habitat within an agriculture production landscape. © 2016 The Wildlife Society.},

A magnetic compass is widespread among animals, magnetic navigation is indicated e.g. in birds, marine turtles and spiny lobsters and the use of magnetic 'sign posts' has been described for birds and marine turtles. For magnetoreception, two hypotheses are currently discussed, one proposing a chemical compass based on a radical pair mechanism, the other postulating processes involving magnetite particles. The available evidence suggests that birds use both mechanisms , with the radical pair mechanism in the right eye providing directional information and a magnetite-based mechanism in the upper beak providing information on position as component of the 'map'. Behavioral data from other animals indicate a light-dependent compass probably based on a radical pair mechanism in amphibians and a possibly magnetite-based mechanism in mammals. Histological and elec-trophysiological data suggest a magnetite-based mechanism in the nasal cavities of salmonid fish. Little is known about the parts of the brain where the respective information is processed.}

Many theories on the evolution of bird migration assume a framework that extant migratory species have evolved repeatedly and relatively recently from sedentary tropical or subtropical ancestors. We performed ancestral state reconstructions of migratory behaviour using a comprehensive, well-supported phylogeny of the Parulidae (the 'wood-warblers'), a large family of Neotropical and Nearctic migratory and sedentary songbirds, and examined the rates of gain and loss of migration throughout the Parulidae. Counter to traditional hypotheses, our results suggest that the ancestral wood-warbler was migratory and that losses of migration have been at least as prevalent as gains throughout the history of Parulidae. Therefore, extant sedentary tropical radiations in the Parulidae represent losses of latitudinal migration and colonization of the tropics from temperate regions. We also tested for phylogenetic signal in migratory behaviour, and our results indicate that although migratory behaviour is variable within some wood-warbler species and clades, phylogeny significantly predicts the migratory distance of species in the Parulidae.},

  abstract = {Migratory species exhibit seasonal variation in their geographic ranges, often inhabiting geographically and ecologically distinct breeding and nonbreeding areas. The complicated geography of seasonal migration has long posed a challenge for inferring the geographic origins of migratory species as well as evolutionary sequences of change in migratory behavior. To address this challenge, we developed a phylogenetic model of the joint evolution of breeding and nonbreeding (winter) ranges and applied it to the inference of biogeographic history in the emberizoid passerine birds. We found that seasonal migration between breeding ranges in North America and winter ranges in the Neotropics evolved primarily via shifts of winter ranges toward the tropics from ancestral ranges in North America. This result contrasts with a dominant paradigm that hypothesized migration evolving out of the tropics via shifts of the breeding ranges. We also show that major lineages of tropical, sedentary emberizoids are derived from northern, migratory ancestors. In these lineages, the winter ranges served as a biogeographic conduit for temperate-to-tropical colonization: winter-range shifts toward the tropics during the evolution of long-distance migration often preceded southward shifts of breeding ranges, the loss of migration, and in situ tropical diversification. Meanwhile, the evolution of long-distance migration enabled the persistence of old lineages in North America. These results illuminate how the evolution of seasonal migration has contributed to greater niche conservatism among tropical members of this diverse avian radiation.},

The costs and benefits of colonial aggregations in animals are well established, but the factors leading to aggregation in territorial animals remain unclear. Territorial animals might aggregate to facilitate social behavior such as (1) group defense from predators and/or parasites, (2) cooperative care of offspring, (3) extra-pair mating, and/or (4) mitigating costs of extra-pair mating through kin selection. Using experimental and observational methods, we tested predictions of all four hypotheses in a tallgrass prairie in northeast Kansas, United States. Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum) males formed clumps of territories in some parts of the site while leaving other apparently suitable areas unoccupied. Despite substantial sampling effort (653 territories and 223 nests), we found no support for any hypothesized social driver of aggregation, nor evidence that aggregation increases nest success. Our results run counter to previous evidence that conspecific interactions shape territory distributions. These results suggest one of the following alternatives: (1) the benefits of aggregation accrue to different life-history stages, or (2) the benefits of territory aggregation may be too small to detect in short-term studies and/or the consequences of aggregation are sufficiently temporally and spatially variable that they do not always appear to be locally adaptive, perhaps exacerbated by changing landscape contexts and declining population sizes.},

  abstract = {Grassland birds are in steep decline throughout many regions of the world. In North America, even some common species have declined by {$>$}50\% over the last few decades. Declines in grassland bird populations have generally been attributed to widespread agricultural conversion of grasslands; more than 80\% of North American grasslands have been converted to agriculture and other land uses, for example. Remaining large grasslands should thus be especially important to the conservation of grassland birds. The Flint Hills of Kansas and Oklahoma (USA) preserves the largest intact tallgrass prairie (∼2 million ha) left in the world. The Flint Hills supports a major cattle industry, however, and therefore experiences widespread grazing and frequent burning. We assessed the regional population status of three grassland birds that are considered the core of the avian community in this region (Dickcissel, Spiza americana; Grasshopper Sparrow, Ammodramus savannarum; Eastern Meadowlark, Sturnella magna). Our approach is founded on a demographic analysis that additionally explores how to model variability in empirically derived estimates of reproductive success across a large heterogeneous landscape, which ultimately requires the translation of demographic data from local (plot) to regional scales. We found that none of these species is demographically viable at a regional scale under realistic assumptions, with estimated population declines of 3-29\%/year and a likelihood of regional viability of 0-45\% over the two years of study. Current land-management practices may thus be exacerbating grassland bird declines by degrading habitat in even large grassland remnants. Habitat area is thus no guarantee of population viability in landscapes managed predominantly for agricultural or livestock production. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We developed three guilds from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, which included Species of Greatest Conservation Need, land cover affiliates (e.g., forest breeders), and synanthropic species associated with urban environments. We gathered housing density data for the year 2000 from the U.S. Census Bureau, and centered the bird data on this year. We obtained land cover data from the 2001 National Land Cover Database, and we used single- and multiple-variable analyses to address our research question. In all regions, housing density within protected areas was positively associated with the proportional abundance or proportional richness of synanthropes, and negatively associated with the proportional abundance or proportional richness of Species of Greatest Conservation Need. These relationships were strongest in the eastern forested regions and the central grasslands, where more than 70\% and 45\%, respectively, of the variation in the proportional abundance of synanthropes and Species of Greatest Conservation Need were explained by housing within protected areas. Furthermore, in most regions, housing density outside protected areas was positively associated with the proportional abundance or proportional richness of synanthropes and negatively associated with the proportional abundance of land cover affiliates and Species of Greatest Conservation Need within protected areas. However, these effects were weaker than housing within protected areas. Natural land cover was high with little variability within protected areas, and consequently, was less influential than housing density within or outside protected areas explaining the proportional abundance or proportional richness of the avian guilds. Our results indicate that housing development within, at the boundary, and outside protected areas impacts avian community structure within protected areas throughout the United States.},

  abstract = {The reproductive success of Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum), Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), Vesper Sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus), and Field Sparrows (Spizella pusilla) breeding on a reclaimed surface mine in northern West Virginia was studied from 1978 through 1980. Only Vesper Sparrows showed significant (P \&lt; 0.05) annual differences in clutch size. Predation was the major cause of egg and nestling losses during all 3 yr. Of 185 nests located, 80 (43\%) were presumed lost to predators. Our study site, surrounded by woodlots and pastureland, apparently concentrated predators. We believe northern black racers (Coluber constrictor constrictor) and Common Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) were the major predators. Generally, predators were equally successful in locating nests during the incubation and nestling periods. Variable nesting success, calculated from exposure for the species during the 3 yr, reflects differential predation pressure. Productivity estimates suggest that adults are not replacing themselves and immigration is necessary to maintain a stable population. Apparently, environmental cues are sufficient to elicit a settling response, but, due to predation, reproductive success is low. Although surface mining is providing new nesting habitat for these species, the inadequate reproductive success experienced on our site suggests that these manmade grasslands may not be of benefit to the sparrow populations in this area. Breeding densities during the 3 yr were variable and may reflect poor breeding success, changes in the vegetation, availability of more suitable nesting habitat, and differential mortality during migration and on the wintering grounds.},

  abstract = {The low species richness in grassland bird communities has been hypothesized to result from competition in a simplistic, saturated habitat (Cody) or to result from the periodic occurrence of climatic extremes that prevent drought-susceptible species from perennial settlement (Wiens). Predictions based on these two hypotheses were evaluated using June population estimates on burned and unburned tallgrass prairie over the decade, 1981-1990, on the Konza Prairie Research Natural Area, Kansas. The results of these analyses support the notion that drought tolerance is the primary factor that determines membership in the tallgrass prairie community. When drought and fire are coincidental, however, the community does respond in a manner commensurate with the saturation hypothesis by a reduction in bird abundances but not a decrease in species richness.},
